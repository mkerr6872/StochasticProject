Garage with garage raccoon: 14/10

Thank you for the suggestionRan over two raccoons on my drive back home from work.  Felt bad earlier, now this thread is making me feel ten times worse. Look at all these fuckin' losers without a garage racoon!> My garage raccoon


wait.... what? Completely unrelated to the tires, but is that raccoon a wild one that somehow got used to you and your garage, or was it already domesticated?I came into this thread looking for answers. 

...But I just have more questions.Hi. Can I have a picture of a garage raccoon? I thought this was all trolling until I saw that OP's account is 6 years old. 

Look through OP's post history and you will find his instagram account, with more adorable raccoon pics. 

OP - thank you for this masterpiece of a thread. Within 9 hours, this has become the top rated post in r/cars. 

TL;DR Cute woodlands creatures may "technically be cheating" but is what we're all here to see anyways.You have a garage raccoon? Admit it op: the only reason you posted this was so you can show off your garage raccoons. > My garage raccoon likes to use my rack of winter tires as a fort. He's usually really good about keeping it clean so I don't check it very often

You fuckin' what now?

e: thanks to a kind user for the gold :)Guy told me today he worked on a car with a pack rat that basically turned the thing into an apartment. He had a bed on one side of the rear in the body work, he had a food stash full of apples, and he had a shitter far away from the rest of it. I guess he reached in and felt something furry and it moved and he ran off screaming. Then he investigated further.


My drive to work is basically 15 miles of farmland and then there's a stop light. Almost every morning I see critters crawling out of cars at that light. Mainly mice. I bet the micdonalds at that intersection has a problem.Well, I don't. I have severe ADHD/hyperfocusing so I basically can only excel at one thing at a time. So for example, the past two weeks I've been working on photos while my house is a mess, no progress on the car, and I've only showered about once every two or three days. Today I'm cleaning the house and will forget the photos because tomorrow I have to hustle for enough money to pay bills for the next month. After about a week or two of that I'll throw all financial responsibility to the wind and either start working on cars or be camped out in the woods with six cameras set up attempting to make a raccoon documentary. Short answer is no it won't. Long answer is urine is water based and contains chemicals that can be found IRL and frequently touches tires, so no it won't.

You may try /r/mechanicadvice next time you have a question.

Edt: /u/striple pointed out that the racoon is peeing INSIDE the tire, not outside, and that urea in high concentrations tends to bust rubber gaskets, so even in the low concentrations in urine, I'm going to say it's not great. A lot of great arguments about acidity and pathogens, but I'm not sure how these would effect rubber without more study.

Also, /u/justalittleaverage had a great method of keeping the wash bear out of the tire, and /u/xhauhst put in an advert for autodetailing. Not sure which sub would be better honestly.OP be careful about avoiding Racoon roundworm. If you catch it you can lose your eyesight and have permanent brain damage. It is fairly common in Racoons in Michigan particularly.

http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,1607,7-153-10370_12150_12220-27261--,00.htmlNo it won't
[deleted][deleted][removed]Coming here from /r/all, first time to /r/cars. What, uh, exactly is this sub about? 

Also, former auto mechanic and tire installer. No, urine will not impact tires.Those are M-Pars aren't they? That's actually hilarious. [deleted]What is going on in this thread??? I'm confused but I love itAlright this is the best thread ever. Jesus I wish I could upvote you into oblivion. I kept scrolling down the thread like what? More pictures.. WHAT! OH MY GOD THIS DUDE IS FOR REAL. So awesome. [removed]No, but it could damage you.  Raccoon urine can carry leptospirosis, a bacteria that can be transmited to humans.  Filling a urine-soaked tire with air and the  letting the air out could aerosolize the bacteria and endanger you and your tire guy.  Wash them down with bleach before you employ the tires. /r/trashpandas will LOVE your garage raccoons. :OShut it down. Reddit is done.

[](#bot)Not near as cool as a garage raccoon, but my uncle once had a garage cat. At one point, he took a road trip a few states away, stopping for gas multiple times and eventually staying in a hotel. Shortly after arriving at the hotel, out from under the car pops garage cat, looking cool and calm as can be.  

He still has no clue how that cat made it all that way, or why it decided to go on an adventure that day. Nonetheless OP, I would make sure you don't pull more Disney-level crap and accidentally take a raccoon and his squirrel friend on an adventure across the country. Unless you really want to. 

Nevermind, do it. Post pics. [deleted]I'm over here in this coffee shop losing it. Tears running down my face. I haven't had this hardy of a laugh from reddit in the longest time. 

*What in the fresh hell is going on?*

Oh my goodness. This is Best Of material right here. I've never seen OP deliver so well.I bought My 4runner from a guy that had a pet raccoon, dude was just a blue collar career carpenter. Half way into buying the rig he asked if I want to see something cool, opened his door, called out and out walks these little dude scampering around. It was dope I got a good deal on my rig and got to play with a pet trash panda CHECK OP'S HISTORY.

How are they doing today?? This is now my favorite thread on Reddit, your garage raccoons are just tooooo darned adorable!!!!!Can I know more about the raccoon?

I don't think small quantities of urine will hurt the tires, just spray them down a bit now and again.Best. Thread. Ever. I gotta thank you for posting all your raccoon pictures, it totally made my day. Best op ever.My life has been forever altered by this post. Nothing can ever be the same. Today i am a new manAre you married? If not, can I marry you and become the raccoon queen?I really want to know now if pee will damage tires, and all I see are racoons!Wow. You literally have pet raccoons. 

Maybe I'm just tired and this thread is telling me it's time for bed....This is going on r/bestof We need a amaThis is one of the funniest threads I've ever come across[removed]Welp, this is the best thread /r/cars will get this month. Pack it up, gentlemen, I'll see you all in 30 days.I have no idea what the fuck is going on here but I love it.Typically the diesel nozzle is much larger than the gasoline nozzle and you can't fit it into your car, but I have seen diesel nozzles the "smaller" size. 

Other posters have stated what to do, call a tow truck and take 'er to a good shop or take it home and drain the gas tank yourself. Majorly screwed something up. 

Noticed immediately. 

Did not exacerbate the problem.

Got help immediately. 

Recognized that there wasn't actually a problem. 

Admitted the mistake with humor. 

You're gonna go far, kid. [deleted][deleted]How? the Diesel nozzle end is too big to fit into an unleaded filler tube. Did you like, hold it there spraying diesel everywhere?Found the Oregonian.get it towed to a shop; if you havent run it all you need to worry about is having the tank drained. if you ran it you are fucked and will have to have the injectors cleaned as well as the fuel lines etc Mate and I were going out of town late one night and filled up. Left the service station and got about a kilometer up the road when the car started to run roughly and lose power. So much so that it would only move at just above idle. As soon as we tried to accelerate it would die.

We decided to go back and get another car. About a kilometer past the service station we noticed a car on the side of the road with the bonnet up and remembered that he was filling up the same time we were. We stopped and sure enough he had the same problem. He had filled his tank and the car wouldn't run at all, we had just topped up so we knew it must be a fuel problem. 

So he and his passenger jumped in our car and we headed back to the servo. The kid working there had no idea what to do when confronted by two lots of pissed off customers. We got him to turn on the pump and found it was diesel instead of regular petrol. He said that the tanker had just been there before we had both filled up and must have filled the wrong tank.

He rang the owner but got no response so he was all out of ideas.  By this stage it was about two in the morning and we didn't want to hang around any longer. We found a drum and were able to drain our tank and refill with super. We demanded our money back as well for our trouble. Went on our way without further problem. 

No idea what happened with the other customer but he wasn't happy.

This was a car with a carburetor, no idea how an injection system would cope but don't see any reason it would react differently. DO NOT START THE ENGINE.

Get the car towed and have the gas tank drained. If you didn't start it that's all you'll need to have done. The second you turn that key things will get much, much worse.[deleted][deleted]FYI Diesel nozzles are different sized from petrol.  You would have to be trying really hard to fill up with diesel.  > Things like this leave me to believe I won't make it far in life

"Not getting far in life" isn't a result of making a mistake. It's the result of making the same mistake twice. Just make sure to pay more attention next time.You're the man.  Two dumbass moments that canceled each other out.  Plus learning, and admitting mistakes?  Damn, son, you're going far with that attitude.Upvoted because this is totally something that I would do. Glad you didn't actually fill it with diesel.My dad used to be a fuel delivery driver for a chain of truck stops that were local to our state. Ever see the tank lids in the ground at gas stations? They usually [look like this](http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wnpr/files/styles/medium/public/201503/underground_gas_tank.jpg), including the colors. The different colors differentiate the tanks so the right fuel ends up in the right place. Once upon a time he delivered to a stop not usually on his route that hadn't repainted the tank lids in years and couldn't identify one from the other. He even asked the station management and they couldn't tell him for some reason. 

Picked one, and happened to pick the wrong one. Diesel filled the underground Unleaded tank, then into cars without the owners having any idea.

Needless to say the chain paid out some damages, fixed the tank markings, and of course fired my dad.lmao seems you realized you were good quick enough. Enjoy life while you are youngDude how high are you right now?You may think you get magical adult knowledge, but you don't. These kinds of things won't stop, ever. You just get better at dealing with and hiding them.This thread has really taken off. We'd like to remind everyone to be civil to one another. If you think someone has gone too far, please report it to the mods and we'll look into it.[deleted]I accidentally put 5 liters of diesel in my car at an old gas station when I was on a road trip; I was tired and didn't notice until I got a whiff of diesel. I tried siphoning, but I quickly found out that my car has an anti-siphoning device. I spent the next hour researching and doing maths to figure out how/what I could do to not fuck up my engine. What I ended up doing was filling my tank up with premium, and then topping up with more premium every 100 kilometers or so. My car was still running 600 kilometers later, at that point I ran the car until it was nearly empty and pretended I hadn't put diesel in my car in the first place.

I know you didn't actually put diesel in your car, but if you're ever in that unfortunate situation, there are still ways to not screw up your car. Definitely save the diesel. It’s worth more than your carFor future reference, if it's just a little bit in an older vehicle it's not the end of the world. Just put as high of an octane gas as you can in and you should be fine.

If you put more than a few gallons in or it's a newer vehicle, have it towed to a shop and have the tank drained. I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

Heck, my Chevy Duramax 6.6L V-8 turbo-diesel gets 15.3 mpg and only cost $64,996. I’ll never make the mistake of putting diesel in a gas tank again after paying that much. I only bought it so I could tell my friends they only ask for my help moving because I own a truck and because I thought the guy who sold it to me was kinda cute. We exchanged numbers and I told him about how I can’t read and he said he moonlights as an English teacher. One thing led to another and after a night of passionate love/pegging in the back of my fully loaded crew cab, I convinced him to buy a truck just like mine. Who’s the salesman now, dad? ARE YOU PROUD OF NOW ME DAD?I used to work at a Honda Dealership back in the late 90's before the different size nozzles and this happened probably once a month... Most didn't realize it until their car shut down a few blocks away and then had it towed... as soon as they said they got gas and then it died we would open the gas door and that diesel smell was obvious... drop the tank, Drain it, clear the lines, Pull the plugs and clean at the least.. It was $400 plus back then and labor rates were only $65 an hour in those daysHoly shit I had a 2000 Pontiac sunfire too. Loved that girl[deleted]this will go down in the reddit post hall of fame[deleted]Hey bud, late to the party but I used to work in fuels so thought I would chime in to give you information just in case you find yourself in a similar situation in the future.

I don't know what the price per gallon is in your area, and I don't know the capacity of your tank.

First, you'd want to try and siphon out as much of the diesel as you can. You can usually get these manual pump things at an autoparts store. They don't work great though. I prefer getting hose and doing it the old fashioned way.

After you've gotten as much of the diesel out as you can, you just fill it up with gasoline and you're good to go.

Now, if 7 bucks is only a few gallons in your area, like it is in mine, you'd just be able to put gasoline in with the diesel and the gasoline would essentially "Overpower" the diesel.

The car has the potential to be a little sputtery as it burns through the diesel/gas mixture, but it wont actually cause any damage to the vehicle.Lol! This is the cutest thread I’ve seen all day. 

Thanks for the laugh! We all make mistakes but at the end of the day thank your dealer for that boom ass chronic he gave you People have been pretty brutal to you. Remember that mistakes are life’s teachers. This was an honest mistake, you’re not stupid for not knowing what diesel was, but you know what? I bet you will never forget. Take the comments with a grain of salt, and don’t be so hard on yourself. You’re only 17. I thought I had it all figured out back then, and I have been taught many many many times since then that I didn’t. Hey dude, just wanted to let you know: don't worry. We all make stupid mistakes sometimes and especially so when we panick - and being young increases the chances of panicking (the whole life experience thing) so don't overthink this incident, don't let it make you feel stupid or bad. Roll with it, laugh about it, we all do this shit at some point. Maybe not diesel/gas - but look, I lost my mom before she could teach me cooking. So I had to teach myself. In my unerring love for all things garlic, I made a whole lot of recipes involving garlic. You may ask yourself: well what's the fuckup there?

The fuckup is when you mistake garlic bulbs/heads for garlic cloves/toes and instead of adding two garlic cloves/toes as the recipe calls for, you add two entire frigging bulbs/heads instead. And you end up loving it. And you think it's supposed to be like this. And then you continue for about half a year until you live in a student dorm. And you serve your favorite dish (with a loooooot of garlic) and share it with your dorm mates. 

That's when you realize: you've been an idiot for six months and not everyone loves garlic as much as you do ;)

Hope this cheered you up some! 

Things like this leave me to believe I won't make it far in life.
same.The only suggestion I have for you is try a bit of Mindfulness. It's tough being in the present at your age, but learning how to be, on demand, is worth a lot as your life goes on.Give yourself a break. I did stuff like this as a teenager. We’ve all been there. the fact that you're being humble about it shows that you actually will make it far in life, so chin up dudeDon't beat yourself up bud, you had the good instinct not to start the car until you knew it was safe. That could have saved you a costly repair. Being prudent will always pay off, even if it was for nothing, you didn't worsen your situation.When I got my first car at 17 I didn't realize you needed to change your oil. I literally never changed the oil. Never put oil in it. Never even thought about it. I fucked my engine up big time. Had to trade the car in for parts. I felt like a fucking dumbass. Overall, shit happens. You live and you learn. At least you were able to recognize it. I like this post. This post made my day.Are you perhaps an Oregon resident?Don't feel bad; it could have been worse. You could have been [this guy](http://www.gixxer.com/forums/27-anything-goes/226570-bike-wont-start-after-using-nos-fuel-additive.html).Don't be too hard on yourself, you'll do some much stupider shit later in life and look at this back and say that was funnyHey, don't stress. Everybody fucks up sometimes. I saw your update, but even if you had managed to fill it with diesel at least you had the sense not to drive it and to ask for help.When I switched from diesel car to petrol car, I almost did it.. I remember holding a diesel gun, staring at the car for a while and think: do I miss something?Everyone makes mistakes and gets confused at times. Don’t be so hard on yourself bro. Exact opposite. This level of self awareness and willingness to admit mistakes will take you far in life.Better to look a fool, than to be a fool. You did the right thing seeking help rather than taking your chances.

Glad you didn't have diesel in your tank :-)'I'm seventeen and relatively new to driving my own car'      

can confirm that im eighteen and am depressed of not having my own car
I think everyone fucks up once in their lives.

I used to work at a campground/Festival grounds where we had gas golfcarts to get around on. Well this new guy started, much older than I but dumb as a doorknob. But he did know a few things here and there. Never did I think he would mix gas and diesel. 

So one day he comes up to me telling me his cart isn't working well. I get in and hit the go pedal and it goes ten feet or so and stops. Goes ten feet stops. So I say fuck it we'll look at it later, big boss man needs help with something. So big boss man is on the front end loader and says we need to fuel up first. We had our own above ground fueling tanks. One for gas and one for diesel. 

We get to the fueling stations and new guy goes and grabs the gas nozzle clearly labeled gas and in the red tank (Diesel was in a white or yellow tank marked diesel) and almost puts it into the loader when boss man  catches him and ask what the fuck he was doing "THAT'S GAS" he yelled. New guy goes to put the gas nozzle back when I look over and ask if he read the signs. It was right then you could see the gears turning in his head and he goes ^oh ^OH OHHHH NOOOOO! OH SHIT SHIT SHIT!. 

He put diesel in the gas golf cart and just now realized why it didn't work right. 

No big deal though we just used a pump to empty the tank, fill it with gas and it worked fine for the rest of my time there.

As for myself I once went to put a quart of oil in my girlfriend's car and grabbed a quart of power steering fluid instead because same color and sized bottle. Put the whole thing in her oil tank and started the car and got down the road before I  realized.  Ran downtown in my car and got new oil and changed her oil before letting her go anywhere.For future reference the diesel nozzle doesn’t fit in the gas hole to fill up your tank...You'll find that you learn lessons really, really well when it is embarrassing. Some people will end up with 3 or 4 stories where they very nearly tried to gas up with diesel. The OP will have exactly 1 story of the same.
Embarrassment is a terrific teacher.

Also, hello visitors from /all. Please take a moment to review our rules found here: www.reddit.com/r/cars/about/rulesI mean fuck, you are already making him drive 6 hours with a truck full of birds.  I'd recommend smoking a brisket on the way as well to de-escalate the situation.If you MUST dehydrated them see if you can drop it off at a friend or relatives house near by. They can babysit the tomatoes. Just tell them when to turn it off. Have it completely ready just needs to be plugged in.NGL, I lost it when the parrot came into the picture lol.Mods, please pin this because I feel like a lot of people will be looking for this solution as well.This is over *three dollars* ($3), correct?It’s a 3$ case of tomatoes.... fertilize the soil with them (if you’re living in warm weather), or freeze them. Dehydrate another dayA **serious** answer from someone who has done car detailing for many of my youthful years.

It will likely leave an odor for a few days but nothing permanent. Tomatoes don't really have a powerful smell like garlic or onions. And if for some reason dehydrating exacerbates the issue (which i would guess it would actually weaken the smell) just buy a can of Oziom car spray or any other auto "scent bomb", and that will eliminate the scent pretty well.Yo I don't have the answer to your questions, but I just wanna say, this is the best question I've seen posted here since I started paying attention to this subreddit.

EDIT* [I made a commemorative poster.](https://i.imgur.com/hLCSDTT.jpg)[deleted]I think you already know in your gut. He will not divorce you, but this is an unreasonable request and he shouldn’t have to be put in this position. Either ask someone to care for your tomatoes or ditch them. $3. Three dollars.A lot of the answers here are making fun of this question, but please please please DO NOT do this. I have known 12 people who have passed away from thinking they could dehydrate their tomatoes while driving. It’s an issue that is becoming increasingly more common and I have been trying to raise awareness for it, please do not become another statistic. 

I understand it is easy to impulse buy things like this, but it is important to know that tomatoes will take your life in an instant if they get the chance. It was a big purchase but your life is worth more, trust me.I feel like this is a problem out of my grade school textbook. Is this real?Your question just begs more questions.I'd say do it but parrots are very sensitive to air quality, to the point where you can't even use standard non-stick pans around them.Is your marriage worth to you more than $3?I'd divorce you for trying to make me eat dehydrated tomatoes, regardless of where you dehydrated them tbqhPeak r/cars. Pack it up we're done hereSounds like there's enough going on in your lives to bother with dehydrating $3 of tomatoes on top of it.

I would wait for things to return to normal and dehydrate tomatoes when the dust has settled.[deleted]I don’t know if this is truly serious but here’s a serious answer:

Pre-2021 F-150s have inverters rated for 400w.  I googled the power usage of dehydrators and the answer was 300-1000w.  If yours is more than 400w then no you can’t (and if it’s less than 400w but your blower motor isn’t great then it may not work either).Parrot- tomatoes! tomatoes!

Husband- \*sighs\* Jesus Christ.Yes. And you are going to lose the parrot in the custody hearing.[deleted]I desperately want to know the answer to this as wellPractically you have to check the wattage of the inverter and the wattage of the dehydrator. Anything that makes heat uses a lot of watts. If your daughter did not specifically request dehydrated tomatoes do not do it. There are few things as emotionally charged as a man's (or sometimes a woman's) truck. There's that saying "A(wo)man and her/his truck, it's a beautiful thing" so no offense but he might divorce you, even if he drives a less expensive truck like a Chevy s-10. Trucks are just so practical that there's always something to love. Like a man who cooks. Being a flock mate to the parrot, imo not so much. Depending on what your husband thinks of the parrot, you might just find yourself renewing your vows if the parrot gets poisoned by tomato fumes. Your final resort might be too say, can I dehydrate these tomatoes in your truck. I won't complain a single bit if it kills the parrot. Like canaries in a coal mine, parrots are extraordinarily sensitive to air contamination, so it's not outside the realm of possibility that the parrot keels over.  Who's going to eat the tomatoes anyway? I apologize if I did not get the joke, but I doubt anything could be better than what she said.At this point you want to urgently buy your own dehydration truck. The longest loan the better, the higher the percentage the better. Higher numbers are vastly superior. Don’t do anything under a 7year loan at 20%. This is common knowledge on this forum.

This way your husband can keep his truck free of stuff, and your daughter can give birth in the back of your truck helped by the delicious and relaxing scent of tomatoes.

Make sure the new truck’s color matches the parrot however, or this is moot.Your willing to take the chance of annoying or "smelling up" your husband's truck for $3 ?Tomatoes fuming

Grandchild about to pop

Parrot says it overParrot will act as a canary in the coal mine.This sounds like more of an r/relationship_advice question instead of r/cars :DYes, it’s an automatic divorce. Because of the parrot not the tomatoes.Does the rear window open? Run an extension from the interior, out the window to the bed? Although, then I feel like you might have a parrot issue.you had me at "impulse bought"There is a parrot involved?I love me a good shit post, and this is one of my favorites so far.You'd be better off just tossing the tomatoes or finding another use for them. If you attempt this and there is a lingering smell, it'll cost way more to have a detailer run an ozone generator to remove the smell. If there is a situation on the road that requires a sudden maneuver and the tomatoes spill out, it's going to cost hundreds to have the interior cleaned to remove the stains on top of having the ozone generator ran.

What I'm saying is you're running a high risk of spending a *lot* of money to justify not wasting $3. Maybe try one of those plug-in timer things that automatically shuts off after a set amount of time. That way you can leave the tomaotes dehydrating at home and have the dehydrator turn off around the time they would be done. But whatever you do, don't bring that into his truck lol.Just wait till the baby comes, what's so critical about these tomatoes?It's a 3$ case of tomatoes, certainly not worth risking mood ruination on a very important day for your family IMO. I would ask him what he thinks about it and go from there. If you had more time maybe you could test it by leaving a towel next to the vent and see if it picks up the smell for an extended period of time. For this to be a proper experiment you can only do to the towel what you're willing to do to the interior of the truck.Should be fine.

This comes down to if you like the smell of tomatoes or not, possibly for a short while. Personally, I would be down for this!

In the way of long term smells, won't/shouldn't be any. You might be surprised at the things that get pulled out of a car during a detail or trade-in process. Almost all smells come out with a simple cleaning and the more difficult ones you ozone the cabin.

Smoke (think cigarette), or worse, are different. Smoke permeates due to the chemicals and how they bond with the AC vents and other petroleum based products in the vehicle, like plastics and ducts. You are essentially laying down a thin layer of a chemical varnish when smoking that you have to manually remove with direct chemical application. Can't do that in vents!

**Plus, you get to nickname the truck Mater!**This thread is giving me vivid Car Talk nostalgia.Jesus, my life is so boring.I love that your parrot is such an integral part of the family that it obviously have to be there when your daughter gives birth.You need to honey. Where else are you going to find tomatoes? This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. If he doesn't let you, then leave him.No idea but please let us know the final results (both your tomatoes, truck, and your marriage)I’ve dehydrated French fries in all of my cars. No ill effects

And congrats BTWThe year is 2050 , little Jimmy's grandfather is putting him to sleep with the tale of the great tomato crisis of 2021.

"Jimmy",his grandfather said "2021 was supposed to be a year of hope , a year where people thought things were finally going to return back to normal,no more being stuck inside ,no more of staring at screens all day, no more living in a constant fear of catching a deadly disease or worse seeing your co-worker half naked in his undies. Things started out good too, we had a new not crazy president, vaccines were being administered and in general there was hope but things soon changed for the worse , people stormed the Capitol , Texas got covered in snow and Myanmar had a coup.But the most worrying thing of all was the great tomato crisis of u/ductoid ,for she was faced with the dilemma of whether or not to dehydrate her $3 worth of tomatoes in her husband's truck risking it smelling like an Italian Nona's sauce cupboard and a possible divorce from ruining his beloved ford-f150.Things were further  complicated by a particularly emotionally clingy parrot,whom they had to take with them in the truck and her daughter who was going to be giving birth at any second and was the reason why u/ductoid was thinking of dehydrating her tomatoes in the truck on the long drive to their daughter place.

u/ductoid presented her dilemma infront of a forum of virgins and weebs.Answers came in from far and wide.Some where useful ,some not but most just made fun of her,for what kind of a woman would risk her marriage for $3 worth of tomatoes.But for u/ductoid it was a matter of principle.So,she finally decided to go ahead with her plan.As her daughter's water broke she and her husband rushed to the truck,loaded up their parrot and the dehydrator with the tomatoes inside them.

The first couple of hours were pretty uneventful.The parrot was doing whatever parrots do and the dehydrator was working without a hitch,its constant low pitch hum being almost soothing.u/ductoid and her husband though excited , were also reminiscent of all the fun and romantic memories they had on long trips like these both as a family and a couple but little did they know that this was the calm before the storm.

As hour 4 of the unforgettable 6 rolled around ,u/ductoid suddenly heard the parrot squeak ,"Mel,where are you ??".Who Mel was is a story for another time but all you need to know was he was the parrot's previous owner and had since passed away.
Startled by the noise ,u/ductoid waking up from her nap looked in the back seat and what she saw shook her to the core.The bird cage's door had come undone and the parrot had managed to get one of the tomato loaded trays out of the machine.As she watched on,like a car crash happening in slow motion,frozen by the realisation of her worst fears coming true,the parrot's sharp claws crushed a tomato, sending it's juices flying all over the seats.u/ductoid lurched to get the remaining tomatoes out of the parrot's reach but alas she slipped on the slick tomato juice covered seats and sent the entire load of her dehydrator flying.As her husband watched on in silence from the driver seat not able to take his eyes of the road all he could make out was the smell of tomatoes that had filled the entire interior of the truck.Meanwhile in the back seat there was a war raging on. Millions of years human evolution against one extremely emotionally compromised parrot who was intent on making his dinosaur ancestors proud.There battle was one of epic proportions,u/ductoid  saving as many of her precious tomatoes as she could,displaying athletic abilities which only come from raising kids while the parrot was busy committing tomato war crimes, crushing and gnawing at their plum red skins   making crimson streaks of tomato juice flying anywhere and everywhere and simultaneously chanting it's maniacal warcry of ,"Mel,where are you?".The battle between the allied powers of u/ductoid and the axis powers of avian tomato genocide continued for the rest of the journey.As the husband parked his truck in the driveway and finally looked at  the back seat ,he couldn't eve muster a single word.The scene that met his eyes would make even the most stone cold man cry.The parrot was passed out in its bird cage with its door wide open.On the other end of the seats was u/ductoid,his beloved wife of many years with a look of despair in her eyes for she could save none but only three of her precious tomatoes.As the husband looked on all that met his eyes was how much of his leather interior was covered in drying sticky tomato juice.As two painfull drops of tears rolled down each of his cheeks all he could say was ,"u/ductoid just promise me,you will never again even think of dehydrating anything."

As grandpa ended his story he noticed Jimmy was fast asleep and all he heard was a voice from downstairs squawking,"Mel,where are you?".I usually dehydrate mine by stuffing them in the exhaust pipe[removed]Did you option the truck with the dehydration package? Pairs well with the air fryer package. Honestly can't drive a F-150 without it.Serious Ken M vibes here.I feel like I just got a sneak preview to the Ford F-150 2022 Superbowl Ad.You’ve got a complicated life.what the fuckYou could technically run an extension out back window, tie the dehydrator with bungee cords to secure it and leave it out during the drive.

Alternatively, consider getting a tonneau cover, power was the bed, get cling wrap/a sheet of metal/parchment to cover the bed, then lay the tomatoes down and sprinkle olive oil + salt. Assuming you live in a relatively warm and dry area, the heat absorbed by the bed might be hot enough to dehydrate the tomatoes and make them sun dried. 

Recipe here [Homemade Sun-dried Tomatoes](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/oven-sun-dried-tomatoes/)

The recipe says it takes about 2.5hours. Your 6hour drive is more then sufficient.You have a literal canary in the metaphorical coal mine, I think you're set lol.For the safety of the birds absolutely not. It will kill them. They dont have lungs like we do that can filter shit. They have (depending on the species) about 9 air sacs and they have zero ability to filter fumes. In fact you shouldn’t have candles, teflon pots/pans, or anything that can aerosolize in your home as youd be significantly be affecting their health. You wouldn’t even know it unless they died since they hide illness ridiculously well.I love this question, especially the parrot part.[I think you have a strong opportunity to expand your manifold recipes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine_cooking)

It's your manifold destiny.Forget the god damned tomato’s they were $3Why would you go through all this trouble for 3 dollars worth of tomatoesJust run an extension cable out the back window to the bed. Problem solved.Asking the real questionsJust put a sheet of cookies to bake on the dash to offset the smell.A vast amount of people are allergic to tomatoes so please make sure to run the air circulation setting so those outside aren't killed by your tomato air.I’d personally just take the tomatoes as a 3 dollar loss. The grief from the 3 bucks is not worth it.  If my mother in law did this to her husbands truck, it wouldn’t even get plugged in, I think he’d drop her in the drive way with a gun. Don’t come between a man and his truck. They’re hard to separate.I think the more important question is whould the parrot divorce you for dehydrating tomatoes in the same car...NTA. He's lucky he married you and should back up every crazy scheme you have. If not find a man that will let you dehydrate tomatoes in his pickup.As a bird owner, it will 100% kill your parrot, they have super sensitive noses and any kind of fumes can kill them, please do not murder your bird.In high school someone pranked me by pouring tomato sauce on my windscreen.  It got into the AC intake and my car smelled like funky tomato forever.

You should definitely dehydrate tomatos in your husbands truck.I'm surprised anyone who owns a bird is concerned with the cleanliness or smell of a given area they put said bird into.Now THIS is the ideal use case for a F-150.I feel like this post is making the "use the search function" people cry...Your husband should be impressed, if anything. Tomatoes dehydration is exactly the level of work that the 150 is designed for.You could just use a smart plug at home (a pack of them are like $15–20 or so on Amazon, usually) and turn it off remotely or set a timer in the Smart Things app - that's my go-to for dehydrating shit if I know I have errands or potential interruptions that'll take me away from the house.

Or, you know, a timer people use for Christmas lights and lamps when they're on vacation that you can get at Target.Decided to follow this subreddit after reading this post. I need answers to questions like these.I love when a random, less front-pagey sub gets such a fantastically bizarre post that they make the front page.I feel like I'm in r/subredditsimulator right now.If it were jerky this would be a much easier answerThis is a perfect opportunity to upsell your husband on getting an E class Mercedes or higher. As these vehicles all come built-in with a Mercedes perfume system, meaning you can dehydrate and hotbox as many tomatoes as you want without leaving an odor. This is the galaxy brain move.Please be careful dehydrating tomatoes. Some variety’s will actually hatch since the dehydrator acts as an incubator. Roma’s and beefsteaks produce the worst offspring. Skip the dehydrator and since the truck is available do what I do when I dry upwards of 7 bushels. You’ll only need kabob skewers. Skewer all tomatoes on the sticks an place in the engine compartment of the truck. Don’t worry they’ll all fit once you slam the hood. It takes approx 6 hours to dry so you’re good to go there. I don’t know much about parrots, I’m a tomato guy.You seem to have one hell of a family going on and I want inYou could try skunk spray to get rid of the tomato smell? It makes sense because tomato juice reduces skunk spray smell so the inverse should work.People out here acting surprised, but I could see my wife doing exactly this. She would say:

"Would it be weird if I deyhdrated these tomatoes on our road trip?" 

And I'd have to be like, "No it's fine" because I take great comfort in knowing that I don't ever need to waste money on expensive jewelry knowing that it wouldn't make her as happy as that $3 pallet of tomatoes alongside all of the dreams/aspirations that accompany it.

Let us know how they turn out!It's doable. Fresh air would come in while you drive from the AC. The smell will linger in the car for a bit, but most likely won't remain for too long. Can't give a definite timeline, but I doubt it will last any longer than a month. Plus, you can always Ozone treat it and it'll go away. As long as it's not smoke / cigarettes, the smell won't stay.$3 of tomatoes vs ruining the cabin of a vehicle your husband has to dive in for im assuming his livelihood. Depends entirely on how good your husband is to you, but if he aint treating you right.... I say dehydrate those tomatoes babygirl.If the back window can open why not strap it in the bed and run the power cable into the cab? No fumes are good for birds. Some are too sensitive for simple candles.You can do this if you have more than 200,000 miles on the truck.Wot in Betty CrockerJust eat the tomatoes. They're delicious and nutritious.I would be less than pleased if it left a lingering scent. You could mitigate it by leaving the windows open and worst case a thorough cleaning of any carpet/upholstery will help get rid of it. An activated charcoal bag absorbs scents to a certain degree and an ozone generator can be used as a last resort.


But the real question is it worth it to risk the lingering scent and have to go through the expense or trouble of getting rid of it for $3 of tomatoes?Let’s start a GoFundMe to help cover OP’s tomato costsI ran my dehydrator for 4 weeks in a row without issue so you should be able to set it and forget it at home and not worry about the tomato smell.$3? Depends how you would evaluate the financial aspect of the marriage LOL.Based on my mother in law’s cars, regardless of the tomatoes, the car will never smell right again after the bird rides in it for 6 hours.  Those things are NASTYIf you think ‘murder’ is ‘divorce’ then yeahWhat is this top tier shitpost lmao. Good job OPIf he didn't divorce you over the parrot, he won't for this. 

I say do it, only so your husband can tell this story for years about how ridiculous y'all are.Why don't you just get an outlet timer to shut off the dehydrator after you have left. Like those ones for Christmas lights.This is a classic Car Talk question, I can imagine the brothers just cracking up in my head.Is this real life?First of all what the fuckCan you return the tomatoes? Just claim they’re defectiveHalf the people in this thread: -.-

The other half: “We don’t need sleep, we need answers!”This whole thread is like a fever dream.It’s an F150. Might improve the vehicle. :)How many outlets could the doctors need at the hospital? Just load your daughter and the docs up in the F-150 and by the time the baby’s out, you’ll be back at home to enjoy your freshly dehydrated tomatoes.Dehydrate the husband instead, you'll get a better flavorNo, the dehydrator really just removes pure water. If there is a little tomato smell I think it would dissipate rapidly. Anyway, if the parrot keels over just bail out of the truck. 🦜Neat. Let's see that get enforced now. I think last year, they said that they would start enforcing the Keep Right unless passing rule out here in Michigan. Never happened. There are still many people who drive on the left lane and cruising. So it is now illegal in Nevada to drive below and above the speed limit.~~Fast Lane~~ **Passing Lane**
[deleted][deleted]LOL, so as far as the law is concerned you have to drive the EXACT speed limit, or be fined.  Our traffic laws in this country are so idioticSo, nevada has effectively made driving in the fast lane illegal, since you can never be at exactly the speed limit.lol won't change anything.



in Texas there a TONS of signs that say "Left lane for passing only" and there is always a jackass who only drives in the left lane. Illegal to drive over and under the speed limit. 

Cops can fuck you lane is now open!!So it's now illegal to speed and, if you're in the left lane, illegal not to speed? Where's the sense here?"STOP FLASHING YOUR LIGHTS! I'M GOING EXACTLY THE SPEED LIMIT" Yeah. Not a fan of this. Just get undercover cars and pull over cars that have a convoy behind them and refuse to move over when they have a gap.i blame poor driving education. guess people figure if road etiquette isn't mandatory then they have a right to drive like a dick.

carpooled with a guy who insisted left lane was just another lane, there shouldn't be cars driving faster than us, and cars could just go around him. so fucking embarrassing riding with him. homeboy never made the connection that we'd get honked at and flipped off exclusively when he drove.I live in Las Vegas so I'll chime in. I believe there have been 13 citations.

It's not encouraging speeding it's mainly to keep the passing lane open. It's been a nice change, but overall I still see a lot of slow cars in the left lane on my daily commute. I think one problem people are having is with the wording and how the left lane has been described.  We need to stop calling it the "Fast Lane" because anybody going over the speed limit thinks they are going fast and therefor are justified in using it.

CALL IT THE PASSING LANE to everybody you might talk about this to.  Hopefully over time, probably not, the conception will change and people will get into it to pass and get the fuck back over.

Also people sitting in the middle lane and not getting over in the right lane helps cause this.  Another common thing I've heard is that lane changing is dangerous so people try and not do it.  It's only dangerous if you don't look when you lane change and check all of your blind spots.  Say I'm going over the speed limit in the right hand lane passing a line of 5+ cars in the middle lane and then there's a guy coming up behind me another 5+ mph difference.  I'd love to be able to jump into the middle lane and let him by but more than likely there's no space between the line of cars in the middle lane.... and the fucking right lane is EMPTY.  Because of this I use the right lane a lot I find to pass cars.Can someone explain what the fuck a speed limit is thenThere's always that left lane Prius that makes you and everyone else late for work in the morning. 

I'd love for this to come to NY. Unfortunately, this would never be enforced. Its not the speed **limit** anymore, it's now just the 'speed'?This law doesn't make sense.

Vehicle speeds always vary, it's fairly rare to stay at EXACTLY the same speed for an extended period of time. 

So

It's now illegal to drive under the speed limit in the left lane 

AND

It's illegal to drive over this speed limit in the left lane

So you can ONLY drive in the left lane if you are going the EXACT speed limit.

Obviously it won't be enforced this strictly but it's still stupidFlorida recently did this also. It's funny when you see a police officer going down the fast lane turning on his lights and forcing all of the slow drivers to move over and then going on to the next one over and over and over again.Cop: "With probability 1, you were driving an illegal speed."

Driver: "Which offense is it?"

Cop: "Not sure. Radar said 70. Standard deviation is 3 mph."

Driver: "Doesn't that mean that there was a 23.6 percent chance I was in [69.5, 70.5), which would round to 70?"

Cop: "It does, but even in that interval, the point {70} has measure zero."

Driver: "Well, fuck. Hey, who says the mile has an exact definition?"

Cop: "5280 times 0.3048 meters, obviously."

Driver: "Right, but the meter depends on the second, which depends on..."

Cop: "I've got a Cesium-133 atom right here, buddy."

Driver: "..."If I remember correctly the 405/5 merge in Irvine, CA is near 20 lanes across.  Still you see people go all the way to the left, then slow down.  I am all for enforcing this law.  Think of all the lane changes a slow driver causes.Wait so now its just technically illegal to ever driver in the fast lane?

Speed limit = go faster than it and its illegal. Now go slower than it and it is illegal. So you have to be going exactly, say, 60 mph or you cnlan be ticketed.

Makes no sense to have the law written like that. Realistically you arent judging your own speed that accurately...


 If we want to set a minimum speed we should just do it and get rid of this "The speed limit is the speed you MUST ALWAYS GO!!" when legally it is the maximum speed.

If you have a 60mph road, go ahead and legally set a minim speed of 55mph for the fast lane. Or 60mph and raise the limit to 65.

But don't set the speed minimum equal to the speed limit. That's just foolish.

And if somebody here chimes back "You aren't going to get pulled over until 10 over". Then fine. Make thwt the actual stated limit. Gray zones and nonobvious limits are dumb.

Make it clear black and white on the sign. "Speed maximum 70mph. Speed minimum 60mph". Then write the law that you can be subject to fines of 100 / 250 / 1000 for (rounded up) increments of 5mph outside this (or whatever numbers make sense). 

And please put a "Weather permitting" note directly into the law... Encouraging in any way people to drive fast if it is raining hard o foggy or something is foolish.So if they can't go below the speed limit, they must either go exactly the speed limit or faster (which is also a crime) seems like a trap to me.Fuck. This needs to go nation wideWhat about rush hour?God I hope California follows next...so irritating when someone is oblivious in the fast lane with a line of cars behind them.I've always thought that speed limit laws were fucking stupid. Technically speaking if you're going 66 in a 65 zone, you are speeding and a police officer having a particularly bad day CAN stop you and ticket you and they would be correct in saying you broke the law. However, the driving culture is that you are SUPPOSED to exceed the speed limit by 5-10 mph depending on the situation and if you stay within the speed limit, you are a nuisance on the road (and possibly dangerous). This is stupid. Why not raise the speed limit 5-10 mph and enforce it as a HARD LIMIT with everyone being expected to drive slightly slower? This grey area in the law makes it so that effectively everybody is guilty of breaking the law, and it is up to the discretion of the police officer whether or not they feel like ticketing someone. It doesn't really make sense.They didn't get it right - left lane is for PASSING.  Which means if you aren't actively passing someone you need to move over over.  Does not matter if you're 10 under or 30 over the speed limit.There is no fast lane.  There is the passing lane.  If you are doing 5 miles over the speed limit in the "fast lane" do you think that can keep you from a ticket?

"I was in the fast lane!"[deleted]so they're encouraging people to speed?  or do they expect everyone in the fast lane to drive exactly at the speed limit?Dennis Leary hates this law. 

He like to drive slow in the ultra fast lane. 

While people, behind him, are going insane. pfft... still does nothing about that time that a Nevada highway patrol officer gave me a ticket for 108 in a 70 zone.The problem isn't people going slower than the speed limit, it's people going exactly the speed limit, or 5 over, with the logic of "I'm not speeding so this is fine". If they want to fix this, the law should be that the left lane is for passing only.Really it should be a capital offense. If they enforce it, this shit needs to go nation wide. The next stop can be the Bay Area. Is there anyway you can upvote something a million times?I'm also tired of getting behind drivers doing 20 in a 35 on my lunch break which is only 30 minutes.CA needs to jump on that trainFucking finally!! Do this in all states. Also let us crush them with tanksBout god damn time[deleted]I'm seeing some posts on here that are making the cops out to be hardlined as if you're gonna get a ticket for doing +-1mph. It don't work that way.
The cops here are gonna give you leeway.
They aren't gonna pull you over for passing 5 over, if you fly by in the passing lane 20 over you gonna get nabbed. And they aren't gonna pull you over got going under do long as you don't hold up traffic (within reason.) look guys, I know cops aren't perfect. There are shit heads out there, but lets use common sense.Tennessee passed this last year. It isn't enforced.If this doesn't sum up why laws regarding driving speeds need a complete overhaul, I don't know what does. Virginia passed a bill like this, this year as well.  $250 or $300 ticket, and it's a primary offense, as in they can pull you over for it by itself.
But isn't it illegal to drive over the speed limit, even in the fast lane? In jersey the ‘fast lane’ is now only the passing lane. Dont get caught driving in it too long or some state trooper will pop out of nowhere and pull you over.  Almost guaranteed a ticket ITT: "PASSING LANE !!!1!1!1!!1!1!1!1!" 

It isn't in most states. It's about half of the states where it is.

Most simply have it as a fast lane or suggested for passing, with no laws saying you can't travel in the left lane.

 But this is one of those topics where the hive mind remains uneducated and circlejerks itself to death.

[Relevant article](https://www.jalopnik.com/5501615/left-lane-passing-laws-a-state-by-state-map/)This won't improve anything, other than giving them another revenue source.  It's just another ticket-able offense the highway patrol can use on people driving through the state.Wait, so if that law is in effect, and speeding laws are too, couldn't they just pull over anyone driving in the fast lane? Great, you just created the "cruise control at the speed limit in the left lane, lane"

So pretty much, this will change nothing about most freeway traffic in NevadaWait, isn't going above the speed limit illegal?This works in Georgia.  Except its not the speed limit. If a car is approaching at a faster rate of speed from behind you in the left lane, you merge right as soon as you can safely.  So even if I'm going 85, I gotta get over for the dude going 90. I've seen cops just hit their blues until someone is a lane or two over, then keep on keepin on.Good because those SOBs need to be hung from the tallest tree in the county.Cool.  It's now illegal to drive below the speed limit there.

It's also illegal to drive above the speed limit, anywhere.

So what speed is it legal to drive at in the leftmost lane?  Exactly the speed limit only?  By what measurement?  I recently compared my speedometer to my Garmin bike computer speed.  When my speedometer was indicating 83 mph, my Garmin indicated 77.  

It looks like it would be nearly impossible to drive in the leftmost lane fully in compliance with the law now.The totalitarian principle: Everything not forbidden is compulsory.So unless you are going exactly the speed limit you can get pulled over? speeding or going too slow? That's a nice excuse for cops to pull people over.Seems like it would make more sense to just say “left lane for passing only.” Driving exactly the speed limit in the left lane still slows down and pisses off a lot of people.check out r/bayarea and all the left lane drivers defending their shitty drivingIt's not the fucking fast lane.....

It's a passing lane.

The fact people keep calling it a slow lane means people should drive in it rather than use it to pass.Let's go CAThis is directly related to marijuana. I live in colorado and people doing 5 under the limit is a regular thing. My mom does this and I think she's trying to convince other drivers to slow down too...HEROES.I thought the fast lane was for overtaking. Your not supposed to be cruising in it in the first place. According to a study I read. Making faster moving cars pass on the right is more dangerous than speeding. All I know is someone is getting pulled over on the highway regardless of what they do.I feel like the majority of the problem is thinking of it as the "Fast Lane" and calling it as such.

If we all start referring to it as what it really is, the Passing Lane, maybe over time we wont need laws for things like this.Finally introducing some fucking road etiquette to America Good, they need that law here in the SF Bay.Every state needs to follow suit. 

Driving is a privilege, not a fucking right. People need to start behaving appropriately and have some respect on the road. Why can't the drivers in the USA be like EU?I wish we had a law like this in the Netherlands. You won't believe how many times it happens some asshat drives 100 kph in the left lane to pass a truck while the speed limit is 120 or 130 kph. Just last week there was a row of cars at least half a mile long behind an idiot who didn't feel like driving faster than 100 kph. If I had anything to say about they'd all lose their license.Now driving in the left lane is illegal. You can't go over the speed limit, nor under it.THIS IS THE BEST NEWS EVER!I find this hilarious that republicans would force bigger government Tennessee added this law last year. Nothing has changedIt appears that Nevada has an asshole problem.

"I drive really slow in the ultrafast lane
While people behind me are going insane
I'm an asshole
(He's an asshole, what an asshole)
I'm an asshole
(He's an asshole, such an asshole)"

That's on the booklet when you first get your license. 
They should do that in Florida. It's the passing lane.So you must not be below or over the speed limit in the fast lane or you'll get a ticket? Sounds like a money making scheme.they NEED this in Minnesota!Kind of defeats the purpose of a speed *limit*I believe it was once said by the late great Jeremy Clarkson that any one who drives slow in the fast lane is a pedophile. Due to the fact that the best place to hide is going slow in the fast lane bc no one is prosecuted for it.So it's illegal to drive below the speed limit and I assume it's still illegal to drive above the speed limit. That doesn't leave a lot of wiggle room. God fucking damnit just today I was going to work on a 2 lane highway and one semi on the right lane, ok good and then a fucking asshole on the left lane in front just coasting at the same speed of the truck....I HAD NOWHERE TO GO! fucking bitch. There is no fast lane...Yeah, a few states have this law. People still do it. Police don't enforce it. Actually, most states don't have any kind of "Passing lane" law (Only 7 have a keep right when not passing law). Here is a list of laws for lanes in each state.

http://www.mit.edu/%7Ejfc/right.html
There's no such thing as a "fast lane."

There's a "passing lane" though.Georgia has that and they don't do shit about it. Awesome!! Now someone other than me can tell my mom she's driving too damn slow. They have that Law here in Atlanta. But no one obeys traffic laws or the speed limit. If you are doing 80 mph you are going too slow.Americans, learn this simple rule and abolish such notion as a fast lane. At the very least do it in Europe where it is law. Makes things so much simpler and better.

"It is illegal to not drive in the right most lane unless you are passing someone. Speed and lanes are only correlating as a result of this. It is also illegal to pass someone on their right."


Seems like a perfect excuse for fucking people over through fines. I mean it is like 90% of their job to generate revenue from the working poor. Cool, I'll stay in the left lane doing the speed limit. Passing lane.....it's supposed to be for passing only.In australia you have to be within 20kmh of the speed limitWhy even have a speed “limit" if it is used as a minimum in situations like this. Name it something that makes more sense and only enforce citations on reckless driving, which may include going too far over a recommended speed. Can they do this in Atlanta? And to teach people how  to signal when switching lanes? And how to drive in  little bit of drizzle? And to actually do something about the amount of people who text and drive even though it's illegal? Lots of states already have laws like this (WA has keep right except to pass) but do not enforce. 

I've been pulled over multiple times in my MS3 by cops thinking I [didnt have a front plate](http://i.imgur.com/XPRejBn.jpg) but I have never ONCE seen them pull someone over camping in the left lane. 

In fact, [they had to make an announcement](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/washington-state-patrol-plans-crackdown-on-left-lane-camping/) that they were going to start citing people for this but only for a short window.So it's illegal to drive below the speed limit. It's illegal to drive above the speed limit. So you have to drive exactly the speed limit?Why is this turning into an actual law? You shouldn't be driving slow in the fast lane anyway in the first place. Whoever does that should get their license revoked. If you want to drive slow, you use the right lane.This is a silly law. No one in the fast lane drives below the speed limit. The issue is drivers who go slower than the traffic behind them, but are themselves either at the speed limit or faster.

Example: Most traffic is doing 80, but a driver is doing 70 in the fast lane causing a slow-down.

This is the main issue in traffic from my observations.They need an ad campaign with Hitler driving slow in the left lane so people will understand how bad it isGood. Slow drivers are much more dangerous than fast drivers. Nevada Passes Law Making It Illegal To Drive Slowly (below the speed limit) In The ~~Fast~~ **Passing** LaneAsians....read up on this law. IIRC, it's also illegal to drive over the speed limit in the fast lane (that's why it's called the speed *limit*): the only way you're allowed to pass someone is if they're going under the speed limit in the slow lane.

...So, NV just made it illegal to drive any speed other than the speed limit in the fast lane?They should make it illegal to stay in the left lane for more than 1 minute. That would be far more effective. Since moving to California from Florida, I've notice Californians love to just stay in the passing lane forever. They never get over no matter how many people are lining up to pass. Forcing drivers to pass from the right.This is one step closer to an American Autobahn... too bad most Americans will sue someone if they abuse the rules and screw something up because it *can't be their fault*The law is great in theory- but it's difficult to enforce and left lane cruisers will still sit in the left lane (within the law) despite the traffic flow being 75+ like it is in the DC metro area.It's called the passing lane. In the 90's, Car&Driver used to have as part of their car test, how easily the heater controls could be operated with bulky winter gloves on. (They're in MI.)  It was a rail against tiny buttons back then, but the idea still stands.The cancer is infecting Industrial machinery too. Its fucking awful.I don’t understand why a row of user configurable buttons aren’t a thing. Give drivers the flexibility of software-driven interfaces/UX with the safety and repeatability of physical switches. Drivers can customize to taste. 

Ford had to back pedal on the Mach-E and glued a knob to the touchscreen.I will not buy a car that requires you to use a touchscreen for things you might need to adjust while driving. This includes volume and HVAC. 

Most dangerous trend in the industry. Hey let's ban cell phones while driving but stick an even bigger more distracting touchscreen on the dash of every new vehicle.Related: in Germany, the use of touch screens during a drive has been ruled illegal.

The cause for this ruling was a guy in his Tesla model 3 crashing into a bunch of trees while operating the touch screen.

But here's the kicker: what the guy was *trying* to do was not to change the radio station or something trivial like that. He was trying to change the setting for the wind shield wipers, because it was raining! Tesla relegated the fucking wind shield wipers controls to the *touchscreen*

How absolutely retarded is that?![deleted]In the UK it's illegal to operate your mobile phone whilst driving yet you can poke endlessly at your touchscreen to find a radio station or set your climate to 20.65⁰. Makes sense /s. I'm loathe to go to a newer daily because of stupid design and shitty build quality.They won't stop. It s how they cut costsThis. And button/dial gearshifts too. Can’t stand those[removed]I couldn't agree more. It's much harder to operate a touch screen while driving. Most of the basic functions (sports mode, climate controls, heated seats, radio) should be in button form so you can easily access them on the move.

I think auto manufacturers know this, and in reality are switching to touch screens because they're cheaper. A digital interface, shared amongst manufacturers, is much cheaper to introduce and skin than an analogue interface requiring a unique design for each model, not to mention the cost of the metal buttons and dampening required to make a classy interior.Thats why I love the 21 Mazda3 interior controls. They did NOT install a touch screen they left it as just a screen/monitor. They kept it all analog and you control everything via buttons and twist knobs. Very intuitive controls right in front of the armrest.I'm old, I hate touch screens. They're so fucking annoying to use when you're moving. They're awesome if you aren't, but that's (hopefully) not a common occurrence while driving. The only thing that makes them tolerable on most new cars is the good steering wheel/voice controls. Touch screens in cars remind me of trying to type out a text message on your phone, and you keep hitting O and it keeps giving you a fucking I for no conceivable reason. It's just an extra layer of frustration that actual buttons eliminate since they don't move around on you or suffer from interface lag.They can pry the volume knob out of my cold dead hands!!!The screens on new Volvos use infrared sensors which allows them to work while using gloves.[deleted]I think trying to use a touchscreen while driving is the most ridiculous design.The Jetta had finally left her stranded for the last time. Although we had both worked hard to not only get out of debt but stay that way, I knew she was right when she said it was time to go to the dealership. We had to have a reliable car. 

Three weeks and several awkward, sometimes tense conversations later, I had taken the burden on myself to find a car that would fit her needs. As far as I could tell, it shouldn’t be too difficult. I had listened intently as she discussed with the handful of poor salesmen that were unfortunate enough to approach her on the lot, that all she needed was something that seated 15 people, got 60 mpg, had 1,000 HP, was easy to park, and could be had for around $10K. 


...yep. 

After a little coaxing (and secretly reading a book on FBI hostage negotiations) I was able to convince her a mid-size sedan would fit the bill. I found the most beautiful Cadillac ATS money could buy. ‘14, 40k miles, one owner, and $23k would take it home. I went alone to the dealer with my letter of finance from the credit union and drove it myself. It was awesome. 

The next day, with Pretty Wife in tow, we “happened” across the car lot where the ATS was and I asked “what about tha Caddie?”. She loved it. After a test drive, all kinds were made up and we pulled back I got the lot to start paperwork. She parked next to a Buick Regal. 

“Is that one for sale? Can we drive it?”

I started sweating. All this work behind the scenes I had done could be immediately unraveled if she was conflicted after another test drive. Yet, I relented and we took the Buick down the road also. She loved it more. I was perplexed. Same options, but with less miles and even less money. I asked her on the ride home why she chose it instead of the Cadillac.

“I like the buttons instead of the touch screens.”If it doesn’t have a volume knob I’m not buyingThing is, people LIKE the touch screens. They sell cars. Maybe not here and maybe not to everyone, but blame Tesla.Oof I still remember when Honda refreshed the 9th gen Accord and had touch controls instead of a volume knob. Even today the Touring V6 is a great car for what you're paying but man not having a volume knob hurts. At least they realized and fixed it for the 10th gen.Volvo's touch screen is at least usable with gloves.I got a 2015 Acura with touch screen controls. Hated it.  It is now on my next car purchase check out list.  Go through the onscreen controls thoroughly.  If you don't like it before you buy it - don't buy it.Thank you toyota, love them old school oversized plastic buttons and knobs.Preaching to the choir here. I got in the GTFour today in the pouring rain, punched a few buttons and adjusted a slider, and was demisting in two seconds.I like what Audi has done with new Q3 interior, imo perfect blend of physical buttons/knobs and 2 great screens. Plus, the main infotainment is integrated into the dashboard.

That being said, I think touch functions for AC are here to stay. But I don't like how  VW and Mercedes are lately making steering wheels with capacitive buttons , not that I ever used such steering wheels myself though.I know, right? Searching and looking for the correct touch to increase the Aircon? No problem. But don't you dare touch your phone while driving, it's dangerous!I got “upgraded” on a business trip a few years back and instead of my old reliable Nissan Altima, National gave me a Cadillac ATS.

First thing I noticed was how it felt like the designers had just then learned about haptic feedback.  Like everything had it.  

Change temperature? BUZZ
Recline the seat? BUZZ BUZZ
Volume up? BUZZ BUZZ BUZZ

So many buzzes!  That was when the interaction actually worked.  Since almost everything was a touchscreen or Taptic interface, I never knew if I was changing the station or getting the GPS to work.

It was awful.  It was the most distracting,  car driving experience ever.  I’m good with a touchscreen on my phone: on my car?  Give me a goddamn knob.I also hate digital gauges.They don’t care, whatever makes the most money is all they care aboutYa know, I don't think it's that bad. But the fact that every touchscreen in a car has the same response times and resolution as a 2007 smartphone are what kills it

Like seriously, it's ridiculous that in 2020 they're not all basically iPads in the car. Realistically, it costs the manufacturer like $50-$150 more and would drastically improve the experience.They need to ad tactile or audible feedback.

So you can tell when your finger is on a certain setting, it will either vibrate, or make a tone. Then you push harder to select.

That way they can keep the fancy touchscreens but then you can also tell what you are touching without looking.

It’s only a matter of time before they implement it.I don't even like automatic windows because of the winter.My grandad used to be a pilot in WW2, and when I was little he told us how his blind flight / night flight trainings went with every button and lever being recognizable by shape or texture. So one of his key criterias for picking his cars for the rest of his life was if it could be driven without looking at switches. 
I think he got a point, I'm already annoyed if I have to look for my defrost switch that hides in a row of other AC switches.
I don't get how touch controls can be approved in cars when you're not allowed to touch your smartphone.With a federal mandate to have backup cameras, you already have a screen there so might as well make it touch control. Less electronics and wiring running to each button/switch and you can market it better. 

I prefer buttons/dials. Especially a temp dial that I can just spin to red to make it hot. None of this, 'hmmm do I want to set the climate control to 74 or 78 today??'Yes! I hate them. Had two loan cars earlier this year, VW Polo and Golf and both had touch screens, not hard to suss out where stuff was, but anything besides a race track quality surface and I was constantly pushing the wrong buttons.We are past the sweet spot in cars. That perfect mix of useful technology with practical driving needs.

Cars are now overweight complicated iPads with four wheels.

My want list for vehicles Is entirely from the used market.Plenty of new cars have the right balance.  My 2020 ford has buttons/knobs for all the right things.This is a huge safety issue. You cannot do anything without looking at the screen. I cannot believe this has been so widely adopted. My old Toyota Camry had three simple knobs to control the heating/ac which were simple to use without taking your eyes off the road. I will take that anytime.Thank you. I don't want, I \*need\* to be able to adjust things on the dash without looking away from the road. I can control dials and buttons by feel, can't do that with a screen.**Nothing** in a car that the driver can be expected to adjust while driving should be on a touch screen, it's a shitty and dangerous solution to a problem that didn't exist before said screens.
With a know or a button you can easily control everything through sheer muscle memory and you get physical feedback that tells you if your action has been successful.

With a screen you have to look down to see what you're doing because there is no feedback on whether you're pushing the correct button or not. In Sweden it has become illegal to use your phone while driving but for some reason giant fucking screens that function the exact same are a-ok to put into the car itself?Buy a volvo, gloves work with the touch screen. It's two buttons to adjust the climate features. It works very well once you get use to it.Some automakers are going back buttons and dials for certain interaction, which is good news. For complicated stuff like navigation or drive settings should stay in the touch display for simplicity, although how intuitive the design of the touchscreen is also a big problem still.Ugh, yes, this. I might be able to excuse it on cheap cars, thanks to the potential for cutting costs, but on a luxury vehicle? Compared to the cheap stuff, you should be looking to make the controls feel *better*-- through the use of premium switch mechanisms with better tactile feedback, better materials, more satisfying (if also more expensive) button form factors-- not worse.Didn't the civic remove the volume button for one year lmaoIts cheaper to make a screen then proper set of mechanical switches. But its awfully dangerous. You have to look away from road to change anything, going trough countless sub menus..Along with this, I also find that touch screens are more dangerous than dials because you have to take your eyes off the road to control itThis is the world people wan. More technology, regardless of how useless it is. They want things like touchscreens because it makes them feel rich and important and classy and that they're keeping up with the Jones's, not because they're actually better than physical buttons and knobs. For fucks sake there are screens on good damn refrigerators now. They don't need to be there, they serve little purpose, but people will pay more for it because it makes them look high class when people walk in their kitchen and see a fridge with a screen on it.

People are afraid of living in an analog world for some reason, and it's just sad.Amen, I feel the same.  Climate control and radio controls need to be dials and buttons.  The Tesla screen controls the windshield wiper speed lol.  That’s a hard pass for me.Analog is satisfying, controllable, and just. makes. sense.I want my big back up camera screen... but NO touch screen. No tactile feedback from a touch screen so I have to physically look. Makes bad driving.We need some federal regulation around this. 

Cell phone laws are everywhere, and rightfully so, but it's fine legally to be rooting around in a worse interface on your dash to change the volume. 

We need to specify physical buttons for a number of common in-car functions. Whatever the research says is the top 4-8 things. Mandate physical buttons just like they mandate the red color in tail lights. 

Next Secretary of Transportation is Pete Buttigieg. Let's write him.[deleted]It's also 100x as expensive to repair/replace if something stops workingHonda went to all touch screens in 16 and they are already Reversing adding some buttons backGod yes. Here's one - I have an extremely long driveway. So I turn my car on, start backing up - but then I realize I want to adjust the radio. Nope. The entire user interface is gone since the backup camera is on and the touchscreen is displaying the camera view. I have to stop the car, put it in park, wait for the UI to update, tap the touchscreen to adjust the radio, put the car back in R, and start backing up again.How can touchscreen controls be safe to operate when a cellphone is unsafe and they are in essence the same thing? We should ban touchscreens in cars because they are unsafe.RADIO AND CLIMATE CONTROLS SHOULD NOT BE ON THE SAME SCREENLess buttons, more?All I can imagine is when these cars get a little older you'll have to scrap a perfect running car because the screen took a shit and you can't defrost your windows or turn down the radioThis is one of the reasons I loved my honda fit so much, the climate controls were just, how fast, how hot, where. And all analog, and then in the 2020 they added a volume knob back to the radio. I bought a civic si cause I wanted to trade up to something quicker and a bit sharper to drive and although a couple climate functions are touch there's a huge physical override button to get to them and the main stuff like heat and speed is analog. UX design > flashy uiI just love finger banging tactile flippy switches. Click oooooooh, clack aaaaaaaah, click oooooooh. Don't get me started on indexed knobs.Stop filling out surveys saying the Tesla interior looks the most modern.Mazda has entered the chat. They refuse to make their screens touch screen and instead rely on buttons and dials. I like this method since after a while using you memorize where everything is and do not need to take your eyes of the road.I miss the good old days when I could control temperature and fan speed directly. Now I have to guess what number will make the computer blow cold air.Buy Mazda. No touch screens.AmenI agree. It's also much more dangerous as you HAVE to look at the screen to operate it, whereas a button you can just feel while keeping your eyes on the road.I believe Mazda came out recently to say they are returning to using physical buttons in their vehicles. I hope other manufacturers follow their lead.

I think Tesla has a lot to answer for for this bollocks, they were the first (that I can think of) that replaced virtually all buttons with a big fuck-off iPad and now that is seen as 'modern' other manufacturers are copying their lead, which is unfortunate.I’ll never have a new car, but, having to try to use that screen junk while I’m a passenger in someone else’s is hard enough. You have to LOOK at it - so if you’re the driver - that’s not good! You can use knobs and buttons without taking your eyes off the road.True. And I do not like knobs for a shift lever either. Give me buttons (like the old Plymouths or Edsels) or a lever on the dash board. Yes, buttons are more expensive to produce and install but come on now.I agree. It’s especially annoying with slow, unresponsive touch screensThe new Subaru Outbacks have a ridiculous touch screen with all this shit built into it. I hate when I get 70+ customers trading in their 2012 Outback and want a new Outback, it's a fucking space shuttle for them. It's almost to the point where people over a certain age, I try to skip the Outback entirely and go for a Forester because there's still analog controls.

At least half of the older folks (again, like 70+) I get that come in for an Outback, leave in a Forester after driving an Outback. Shit is too complicated. People don't want to open a touchscreen menu to change the climate control from Feet to Face and Feet.Looking at you [Kia Sorento 2021](https://blogmedia.dealerfire.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/361/2020/09/2021-Kia-Sorento-infotainment-1_o.jpg)Future is now, old manAnalog > digital in 99% of circumstances and no one change my mind.I think it’s so that they have more control over servicing/repairs. Something that cannot be fixed at home or by your local workshop so must be repaired by the dealership. I read a lot of farmers are buying 30/40 year old tractors. Purely because when something breaks they can repair it themselves and not need a rep to come out, plug a laptop in to diagnose the issue then have to be repaired by then....,Okay but just don't buy those cars eitherI’m soooo against no keyhole except for the driver’s door! It irks me so much when my fob’s battery dies and I want to open my trunk and I have to unlock the driver’s door with a key to press the button to unlock the car to open the trunk!!! Keyholes, people!!! A door, a keyhole.You know why you never have to look down at your TV remote? Like that. Cars need to make controls familiar like that.Is there a Cars Circle Jerk sub this can be posted too?No thanks, I’ll take a screen that does multiple things than 100 buttons that do 1 thing.The other annoying thing about screens is that it's less convenient than buttons, because you have to switch to the "right" screen to get stuff done. I was used to adjusting the climate control by feel so I don't have to look away from the road; can't do that with the interface in some of the newer cars.Big reason I bought the LX trim for my Accord. Not enough difference in features except for a touch screen radio. I don’t like touch screen radios, they are glitchy and a pain in the dick when you are driving.I HATE KEY FOBSWhy don’t you just buy a car that doesn’t have this?Buy older carsNoBring back cd players.This is why I dread having to buy a modern car. I don’t want anything newer than 2015, and each year that gets further away...I bought a brand new car 2 years ago. Touch sensitive heating controls on a Honda i was looking at was a big portion of the reason why i didn't buy it and i told the salesman that. It's bloody dangerous and outright unintuitive.
Drivers need buttons and switches so they can feel them and not take their eyes off the road.I truly hate the direction modern car design has gone. So many newer cars feel like they are designed to include as many distractions from the road as possible. And, in my opinion, to be as infuriating to control as possible. 

I should under absolutely no circumstances have to do more than glance down at the HVAC controls to do anything I need to do while driving down the road. Everything should be doable by feel. Basic media controls, too, should not require the driver to take their eyes off the road for more than a few moments. I understand that some modern media functions may be impossible to do then, like XM Radio station choice, but changing volume, changing from radio to CD to aux-in, changing radio station/band or CD track should always have a physical button that can be operated with no or very little visual attention.

I also hate power windows and automatic transmissions with a passion and think new cars are a terrible financial decision, so I'm clearly not the target market.Car Automaker: *No*Car reviewers live in Florida or Arizona.    What gloves?

Why don’t you just buy cars without a touch screen.   Plenty of those aroundToday I watched a humanoid robot do a fucking perfect backflip and now this. I think this is officially the future. 620-mile range is crazy. If that's the future for electric vehicles, I'm down. How the fuck can it do 250?How the hell did we go from the current Tesla to this 630 mile range supercar... I just want a Honda Accord type car with this kind of range. What the hell kind of tire are they going to run to handle that kind of launch? Probably fair to assume it's AWD as well?1.9 seconds? Holy fuck....Millionaires are gonna be wrapping these things around trees like crazylol, it's so fast it'll be straight up illegal to dragrace anywhere with real rules. Those are parachute and full rollcage required numbers jesus tap dancing christ

[deleted]I'm still confused as to how it pulls off a 1.9s 0.60 on DOT tires. Anyone chime in? haha  
edit: not being negative, I want one. Let's see how it does on the track, or lap-after-lap. The Model S has good peak performance, but the battery overheats relatively soon.anyone attempting to exceed 250 mph should expect minutes of treadTesla blowing right past Ludacris send going straight to plaid with this thing. Mel Brooks would be proud.[deleted]It's the 620 mile range that entices me more than the speed.
Speed is sort of a party trick with an electric motor, but making batteries both light weight and hyper efficient is a engineering feat.  If we maintain this curve, we'll see 1000-mile ranges at reasonable prices by 2025.I don't even care about the numbers, that car is *beautiful*. 

I fucking love it. Those performance figures are so ridiculous. I love it.If there's one thing /r/cars must not hate about Tesla it has to be this.

https://www.tesla.com/roadster/?redirect=noAnyone know if the performance figures have been tested or if they're just targets at this point?I have a new dream now. If this thing is even remotely what Elon says it is...

I need to get rich quick.This sounds amazing but I’m still worried about weight.. a 200kwh battery pack will weigh a shit ton. 85kwh pack in the model s is 1200 pounds, so we are talking 2500 pounds just for the battery. Unless there is a major breakthrough is battery tech that drops he weight way down we are looking at a 4500 pound car which is too heavy for track duty :( [Tesla Roadster Page](https://www.tesla.com/roadster/) - Now Live

A lot of confused boners in this sub rnHoly fucking Shit!!!I am skeptical but on paper it’s ridiculous. Please let this happen. 

I’m not sure how I feel about sharing the road with it though. It's official,  tesla and dodge are in a pissing match.That is neck-breakingly fast. Honestly. How do you even drive like that? How do you not get extreme tunnel vision or rollercoaster drop sensations x5 in this?Hmm 250+ mph top speed... It's undeniable they have the power/tq necessary for it, but do they have the handling/chassis/suspension tech to rival that of other 250+ mph production cars like the Koenigsegg?  Meaning can it do 250mph+ "safely"?What is super fast but never arrives?So to reserve one they want $5k deposit (which is fine) but then within 10 days they want another $45k to $245k depending on which car you want.... How high are they? They want me to basically given them an interest free loan for 2-3 years IF they can deliver the car in that time frame. Frankly, that's a load of shit.When I look back at the beginning of my wealth, I'll have this cars incentive to thank. This is unreal, I need one. Obviously given them having problems with getting things to scale, this won't be actually out in awhile.

That being said I'm fine with a prototype to look at even if it's not out for 3-4 years. Could I drag race this thing in fully autonomous mode? That'd be awesome if you could just have the car race for you. It'd probably be horrifying, but cool. >starting at $200,000, with the first 1,000 sold being Founder’s Series models that will retail for $250,000 apiece

r/Nvidia is leaking.[deleted]Holy shit. I feel ancient now for owning a 2017 STIIf it seats 4 it's not a roadster.those are amazing numbers if he can actually deliver what he is promising. well see how it is when it comes out in 2023It'll give the smackdown on ICE cars in the 0 - 60 I'll give it that much, but when it beats out the Veyron SS or the Agera RS then I'll believe him. 

If he put half as much effort into building a track car as he did trying to humiliate ICE's in a straight line, then he'd probably have the Nurburgring lap record right now.And it's a good looking car too. Why does seem Tesla is the only one who knows what's attractive. Meanwhile Audi has infotainment screens with such bad resolution and quality it looks like it was from 10 years ago. And that's a 1500$ package. Like fuck.ill just mount a damn iPad to the dash. Motortrend's annual drag race is about to get crazyCan't wait to see u/doug_demuro test this car out. Electric motors and their godddamn no transmissions and absurd acceleration... it's like the future has been hidden from us all along 

Edit: oil companies ha Great, now can it run around a track for a 30 min. session without going into limp mode? Last time I checked no Tesla could manage more than a few min of being driven hard before it overheated; So I really hope they fixed this one so that it at least has sufficient cooling. 

Oh, so Tesla CAN make a car that doen't look like its mouth has been sewn shut like Deadpool in X-Men Origins: Wolverine.Musk, Musk, hear me out. How's about you release one product successfully before revealing new products to distract investors from the fact that you're in "production hell" and can't find a way out.   

Also, I hope they have figured out how to cool these EVs when they're being put to use for HPDE. Otherwise, it'll be entirely useless to have a roadster with that kind of performance that enters limp mode after half a lap.10,000Nm of Torque? I don't believe in physics anymore 

I want blue flame coming out of the exhaust, a tremendous noise and little kids in my neighbourhood to be running to their mothers in fear when they see a car.  Electric cars don't do any of that...Key quote from source article: "Nissan now has one of the oldest product portfolios in the industry"

in every headlines these days?Nissan isn’t like how they use to be, they’ve lost hella brand recognition and those CVT transmissions are complete shit, they lost me years agoI worked at a Nissan dealership for 2 days, was told I'd be getting a 90 day training program, it was a day and half of the sales manager bragging about how the married life is stupid and how he makes so much money. After that I was told to stand outside in the rain and hope for so,some to come in. After an hour he reprimanded man for standing outside like "a fucking nobody". He then sits me at a cubicle with all the other dealers and a list of phone numbers of anybody that has ever had any interaction with Nissan. You bought a lightbulb for your Toyota Camry 6 years ago in an emergency, well now I'm calling at 6:00 PM trting to get you to buy a Nissan.  I would have to call and try and get a appointment out of you and I had a quota of 1 appointment a day and 2 on the weekends from the phones alone. Throughout the day the General Manager walked back and forth on a catwalk overlooking all the sales floor and if you weren't on the phone for longer than a minute you were being disciplined. After about 50 calls I got up to go the bathroom and instead I headed out the side door and never talked to them again.It’s nice that this new CEO seems to care about making the brand better but he’s got a lot of work to do. What’s the point of buying a Nissan? I can’t think of anything that any of their models do better than their competitors. Give us a new Z and a new GTR. Make the Titan worth considering when up against the Tundra. Make a 4Runner competitor that doesn’t make milkshakes in its transmission. Get rid of those headlights that seek to increase eye doctor visits. Do *anything*. 

More than any other brand, Nissan has let their cars stagnate. It’s hard to believe that they’re still selling 2020 GTR Nismo’s for over $200,000 when it’s the same design that it was over a decade ago. Same with the 370. And they can’t compete with anyone. Try harder Nissan!Nissan has literally skipped a generation of innovation in order to peddle out an unchanged product across multiple lines to maximize profits on outdated platforms.

Car reviewers as well as the public has been quite outspoken over this for years, this isn't a fucking surprise.

Nissan's product line is archaic, losing Carlos may be the best thing to happen to Nissan in the past 10 years.

In other news, Nissan stock is at an all time low, probably not a bad time to buy.I really, really dig the Maxima platinums and everything they have.  I just can't ignore all of the consumer reports about the CVTs though.  It's a shame.Nissan is in rapid danger of becoming the next MitsubishiI love old Nissan but when I get rid of my '03 Maxima, I definitely will not buy a new Nissan Maxima solely due to the fact they have CVTs. Why does a 300hp V6 need to be paired with a shitty CVT? Give me a 6 speed manual or even an 8 speed auto with AWD and you truly have a "4DSC"

Also their whole lineup excluding the newly revised Altima and Maxima is terribly outdated. They need to update their cars more frequently.They’ve been struggling for twenty years.

Making low quality, unreliable models and selling re-branded Renault’s doesn’t help at all. Also, having a “flagship” car like the (R35) GT-R that has been almost the same for 20 years (the original prototypes from the current car are from 2001...) doesn’t help.

Hey, what about caring about doing quality and reliable cars like KIA and Hyundai have been doing.enthusiests wanted the 510 concept to be real... nissan didnt finish the project...toyota86 and the brz came out (what woulda been competition) and are killin it! SMH

&#x200B;

edit: yall comparing it to other cars that are mostly FWD... the 510 Would have sold imo being they were going to market it to enthusiest.. yes that probably would have changed but OG they said you could have bought one for cheap cheap, with no heat/ac no radio, no creature comforts... for folks who wanted to race it or get a bare bones one to mod. WOOD have been sweet. but i digress....   
i did notice it's still on nissans website as a future concept car but looks like an E-car now, shame[deleted]r/cars any time Nissan struggling comes up:

"They need a new Z!"

"They need a new GTR!!1"

"Why would anyone buy a Nissan at all when the Z and GTR are so old and out of date now???"

*Meanwhile in reality the 370z has sold only a total of 71,709 in the last ten years versus the Altima's ‭2,975,219‬*.

Ya'll really need to take care of this lust you have for the Z cars and the GTR because with the current state of things it's not going to happen. The GTR is a halo car and the Z cars are "we have money to waste on R&D for funsies" cars; both of which they'd be real stupid to put money towards when the rest of their lineup needs work.I really wanted a Q60. Those things are fucking beautiful. And the VR30.. Wonderful engine. But then you get inside it. They just now figured out AA/Carplay. For a 50k+ sticker car. 400 HP, rwd, no limited slip. Old ass shitty 7-speed. Infotainment from 2010.

Kinda the same with the Z. New, they're stupid.The best thing about Nissan engines is that Nissan has yet to build a transmission that can outlast one.When I see someone in a new Nissan, I just assume it's because they have poor credit and no one else will finance them. Same for Chrysler products. They're the Official Subprime Car ™As a non-car person, Jesus. I bought a Nissan truck in 2017 and had no idea this was going down. 

Have to say I’m happy with the truck and the dealership service has been top-notch.  No recalls, unlike my wife’s Passat, which seems to get a recall every year.Nissan is not a leader in any segment if im not mistaken. Even their trusty Rogue has lost its top status to the Rav4I'm a service writer and the amount of 2013-2018 Nissans with defective transmissions after 65k miles is insanely high. Just out of power train warranty too. Customers forking out 4-5k for a shitty car they're still making payments on.I guarantee not 1 word was uttered about the GT-R/Z. Dealers know what customers actually care about, and given the sales figures and trajectory of the market it's not those cars.

Thankfully the fixes Nissan needs are relatively skin deep. They can keep the existing platforms & engines. They just need refreshed interiors/exteriors, in the way that Toyota did with the '07-'17 Camry- it was the same car underneath the whole time. Update the infotainment as well (the Maxima's is really good) and get JATCO to ditch the CVTs for regular planetary autos. As a bonus, get onboard the realistic electrification train (aka hybrids). This won't set the world on fire but it will stop the bleeding and address the real needs of paying customers, which is ultimately all that matters for Nissan's survival.Nissan's got plenty of work to do to gain trust and reputation back. My dad's 01 Sentra hit 200k easily before the undercarriage rotted out. That thing prolly coulda lasted another 50k easy otherwise. 

But the past generation of their cars and SUVs were average to mediocre when they came out and sorely outdated by the time the new gens came out this past year. Their lineup is being updated finally and they have the looks but let's hope the reliability on the new models are much better than they've been previously.Nissan is the new Pontiac.

They have a pedigree, but have seemed increasingly lost and stagnant. It won’t be long before the brand is dead with the average car buyer- even if they turn around with good product.When the CVT went out at 68,000 miles on my ‘07 Altima, please don’t question too hard why I didn’t bother replacing it with another Nissan product.Easy fixes here, get rid of the CVT.  Traditional automatics are way better.  The CVT system is way too dimwitted to figure out where to shift to put the power to the wheels.

Next is to not make cars just for fleet sales.  I work at alamo national, and the number of Maxima, Altima, Sentra, Versa, Kicks, Rogues, Sports, Frontiers, Pathfinders, and Armadas is astounding.  And many of them come back with sensor blocking issues, and fishtailing complaints, especially in the ones that are exclusively FWD.  Distribute weight more evenly or give more of your cars intelligent AWD.Kudos for a CEO asking for frank responses, but Nissan really needs a through overhaul. Uh-huh products don't really do it anymore, and companies which used to do so (e.g. Toyota) has gotten the message.We had a Nissan Micra in Canada as a company car. Thankfully it was on lease because within less than 2 years it was rusting everywhere. It didn't look to me like the sheet metal is galvanized, or if it was it was a  supremely thin coat.

Every Nissan I've seen in the last 5 or so years has been complete garbage which is unfortunate because they used to make some really great cars.Imagine a Nissan GT-R with a CVT.

Lmao.Bought my first 2013 Nissan Altima.
Nothing but fucking problems.   Paper thin windshield, the fucking rust everywhere, my wheel breaking off 90 km/h.  All bearings replaced (yeah... all highway driven too).  Car has just over 120k.   My 2008 Honda Accord has 1/2 the rust and 10% of Nissan’s problems at 360k kmI used to like Nissan despite their propensity for eating motor mounts. The last Maxima I bought was pure crap. Never again. They are the worst Japanese brand.Their CVTs will be their demise. They deserve to go broke since they sold to Renault.Their product has gone to shit. From the transmissions to the lack of warranty support. Imagine your CVT transmission craps out on your 3 year old car and they tell you "here's 5k to put toward your repair" instead of just replacing the transmission. They are a fucking joke.My tranny went out on our nissan quest, they want $5,600 to replace it. While in the shop, guy next to me stated he had the same problem. Did a little research and man.... Those CVT tranmissions suck. Never buying a Nissan againThe worst experience I ever had was at a Nissan dealership in SoCal. Right off the Cahuenga pass near Universal. I think it might have even been Universal Nissan ... with the like 3 story building that has cars on the roof.

What a total cluster fuck. I think it was 7pm, weeknight. I wanted to test drive a 370z (this was maybe 10 years ago). There were like 8 sales people buzzing around the place at that hour. It was a picturesque boiler room kind of night. Most or all of them were foreigners, yelling at each other in their native languages, sweat stains on their brightly colored Express shirts. The sales guy who came rushing over to me was clearly a newbie and his english was so incredibly poor that he might have truly only been living in the US for a few weeks or months.

Imagine the most anxiety ridden, overworked and pressured sales person ever trying to convince you to buy a 370z during a Wednesday evening *without being able to speak english*.

I couldn't fucking wait to get out of there.Man, these Nissan threads always devolve into the same "Nissan sucks" circle jerk.  Even if it's true, hasn't the horse been dead for a while now?  Do we need to keep beating it?  The comments are almost the same every timeYeah, but, zero gravity seats!The switch to CVTs were a mistake and ruined the company's imageShocking how even the dealers are raging that Nissans are fucking garbage, and people buy them every day.Almost anything Nissan has put out for the past 20 years, with the exception of the GTR, just feels mediocre.Seeing a lot of comments about Nissan on here, but haven't seen any mention of how they let Infiniti fall from grace. Their lineup in the mid-2000's era was great IMO, and they let their momentum die. Infiniti struck gold with the 4th gen G series. The M35/x was a great mid-sized sedan, and offered many features at a great price point. They had adaptive cruise & headlights, lane departure warnings, good power, solid looks, reliability, and a pretty good ride. The M45 had all of that and a V8 to boot. Add those to the variety of SUV's on tap, and Infiniti had a pretty great lineup across the board. But they let things fall out of shape, and I can't really see why someone would go with a new Infiniti over other options. Really a bummer for how good they used to be.It really seems like traditional car companies can't see beyond the next quarter earnings call which results in a lot of horrendous decisions being made.I like the way the recently refreshed sedans look both inside and out. I can’t speak to their quality on the interior though since I’ve not sat in anything aside from an Uber Sentra a year ago. 

I’d consider test driving an Altima if they put an 8 or 10 speed into it.Nissan fell fast when they partnered with RenaultYup. Nissan are absolutely turd in the UK. Once one of the reliable Japanese brands are trash.

Friends Qasqai has had problems with the gear box and electrics and it's only 2 years old.

Father's friend bought his wife a Pulsar and has regretted it.

Cutting costs and joining with the French did the no favours but then Renault and Citroën have pretty decent products compared to Nissan now...When someone tells you they bought a new Nissan the first response should be:

On purpose?Stop using those horrible CVT engines. Remodel all your cars. Get a new badge. Nissan is lazy compared to its competition. Honda, Toyota, Mazda, Hyuundai and Kia designed their cars from the ground up when they introduced their next generation models.

Nissan? Keeps using those bullshit CVTs and keeps reusing the same underpinnings on their cars since the early 2000s.I’m a Nissan Fan boy and I’ll say this 

If I was buying a half ton truck today I’d buy a tundra.

If I wanted a truck SUV chassis 4X4 I’d have to choice but to buy a 4 Runner.

If I wanted any car or small SUV not a base model with anything but a CVT I’d buy a Honda or Mazda..

Nissan needs to offer options in their drivetrains not everyone wants an uninspiring CVT.

The one thing that Nissan does to good is offer upper luxury in lots of options, I can’t even get a TRD Tundra at 55k+ with factory leather and Nissan has that optionSpeaking from firsthand experience, the Japanese business culture is obsolete in the context of western markets.  Toyota was resting on their laurels until the son of the founder, a car enthusiast with actual vision, took control and transformed their products a few years ago. 

The rest of them have been stagnant for about 10years, and while Honda, Mazda, and Subaru all make generally decent cars, and even some really good cars, there’s really nothing innovative coming out of any of them and with few exceptions their cars don’t inspire passion in most people. 

Japanese management in general is S L O W, not very creative, and afraid to take risks.  It starts with their cultural fear of bringing shame to themselves, and inability to question people with seniority, and it ends with a compensation structure that rewards maintaining the status quo and being extremely conservative. 

Look at the fields where Japan was once dominant, such as cars and consumer electronics, and you’ll see fields where the Korean’s have taken over and the rest of the world has caught up. 

One of the few counter examples I can think of is high end imaging (E.g. photography:  Canon, Nikon, Sony, Fuji still dominate that space) but in that space, the lack of innovation and external competition is leading to the death of the entire segment.  Even the latest high-end camera user interfaces and connectivity are horrendously behind every other area of the tech world.

With Nissan in particular, having to report to a non-Japanese (Ghosn) was shameful, so it wouldn’t surprise me to learn that there was significant infighting over the past 10 years that lead to Nissan’s current state.Had a 2015 Altima.  What an absolute pile of garbage.Every concurrent brand is going forward, especially Honda, Toyota and Hyundai. Meanwhile Nissan seems to be comfortably floating at where they are, not seeming to do anything.It's a real shame that all the cars in their current product range (with the notable exception of the GT-R) feel cheap, outdated and generally depressing in comparison to their direct competitors.

With Nissan's history of making some great cars, you'd expect more.  I hope they get their act together and catch up with the times.My favourite products from Nissan were the Infiniti EX and FX models, don’t care to find out what their current names are. Both models were very unique, in that they had longitudinally mounted engines while being small crossovers on sports car platforms. 

There is nothing that competed with the FX, except maybe the Macan. The EX had good proportions for a small crossover, more of a “lifted wagon” look. They went and ruined the EX, the replacement has a transverse inline 4 with a cvt and an overly complicated variable compression engine, all for a 2 MPG improvement from 20 to 22 combined; the EX had the venerable Nissan V6. Going from a V6 to an I4 with CVT, with the complicated inner workings, gave them a 2 mpg improvement! The FX is long gone with no replacement in sight. With how popular crossovers are, how come they haven’t put genuine thought into these products? It’s like they have given up.Ghosn cut corners and cheapened the brand, now unless they bring in some serious updates nothing is going to change and they will sadly go the way of SaabHad a two year old 45k Nissan frontier fail inspection for broken leaf springs not too long ago. That's pretty embarrassing,  forget about the trans coolers rupturing inside the radiators and causing complete transmission failure by 80k in the SUVs. Terrible cars.I own a Nissan Altima 2020 and for the most part, I really like the car but the CVT is pretty bad and some parts feel really cheap (plastic front passenger adjustment)Good! Nissan doesn’t offer loaner vehicles when your car is in getting serviced. The dealership my wife goes to gets a ton of flack for it and they hate that Nissan doesn’t have a program for it. The Chevy dealership across the street (under the same dealership conglomerate) does. I’ve received loaners from VW, Audi, GMC and Chevy. Way behind the times in customer service.Funnily enough, Ghosn was Nissan's savior back when the Altima 2002 got released. 
Amazing design by then standards, handled well, aluminum subframe and the engines were one notch above the competition. 
Like you could get a 240 hp midsize sedan when the rest at best were at 200.Nissans have been some of the worst cars I have ever driven, unfortunately. Jatco CVTs are absolute rubbish.Others have said it here, but it's obvious to anyone shopping for cars.

2020 prices, vehicle designs that haven't change since like 2003-2005, and crappy jatco/CVT transmissions... forget about it.

Back in the late 90's and early 2000's the VQ engine was an absolute beast and paired well with the maxima, altima, their trucks, and g35.  Now?  Uhhh... ya.

My next vehicle will be honda/acura or toyota/lexus.  Maaaaaybe Mazda.Nissan, I'll solve all your problems with 2 words: Electric IDx.This is sad. Nissan has made some great sports cars in the past and the GTR R35 was a show stopper when it debuted. I saw Titans and Xterras all over the place. Now I hardly see either. The CVT debacle unfolded and it all sank.[deleted]Yeah I’m going to need to see those empty numbers.Does that include the driver in the figure?

Still, a 400-mile range vehicle for 32k (post current incentive)?  Ford has knocked it out of the park.Perfect because most people I know drive trucks like an suv. Don’t see them use near max payload very often.They’re going to sell a shit load of these. I would wager that the average f-150 consumer customer is a homeowner (as opposed to a small car/crossover ev customer who may live in an apartment or condo) and therefore can install the charger. The business customers for who this truck makes sense (local delivery, light construction, trades) probably already have electric service that makes it easy to add the chargers and from a financial standpoint, can view the charging infrastructure as one time capex versus the ongoing opex of fueling traditional trucks. If the dollars make sense, any well run business will be switching to these if the use case warrants it.What kind of drive cycle for this range estimate? 1000 lbs will make a big difference in stop and go, but very little difference in cruising down the highway. There aero is a much larger factor.Goddamn does this, along with inflated the used Toyota truck resale prices right now, make me want to sell my 4Runner to get one of these…“Under promise over deliver.” Great move by Ford.Honestly, now I'm sold. If that turns out to be true, they will be converting a GM guy to a Ford guy. Well done!Bruh, my 2003 F-150 (V8; 5.4L) only has like a 250-mile range.

If I don't use 4WD.

If the weather is warm.

If I have no cargo whatsoever.

If the oil, spark plugs, and all filters are brand new.

If I have some highway mileage mixed in there.

Etc.

If this is true and its power/capabilities are at all comparable....man, they've knocked it out of the park.What about towing a 3k-4k boat, or a camper?I don't get it.  What's the point of a standardized test like the EPA rating if you are going to introduce extra variables?  Ratings like this are supposed to help the consumer compare different models, apples-to-apples.  

I´d very much like to see expanded EPA ratings for trucks, ranging from completely unencumbered to X amount of pounds on the bed, and then also towing some standard(in terms of weight and aerodynamic shape) trailer.  People need this info.I am just gonna leave my [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/nmoerr/mkbhdford_f150_lightning_impressions_better_than/gzrq5c6/) from the other thread here.Unless you're hauling 100 sand bags I dont think it will be more than a 30 mile increaseI wonder how big of a battery Is reqd for a Ford F-350 dually evFord has taken a page from Porsche’s playbook. Good for them.Well the typical American male in his 40s Accounts for 30% of that thousand pounds.My hybrid gets 30 miles max on electric.  When pure electric cars achieve ranges of 400-500 miles, it will be a game changer.[deleted]The Ford Lightning Raptor is going to be sick!Can't wait for my preordered Cybertruck!This is all just speculation.

Stop saying that Ford “under-promised and over-delivered”, they haven’t delivered anything yet.1000 pounds is basically 5 construction workers.So are the first buyers of these things going to pay MSRP for them?  I hate fucking dealers.  I wish Ford would change it up and sell these things at fixed prices.Good guy Ford, providing real-life, usable data. 

Propsyeah maybe if you put it in cruise control at 50Cool now make a Ranger EVThe real question is, what's the mpg if you exclusively charge your batteries with the optional built in generator?imagine how far it can go with nobody in itMaybe they didn’t realize that many of their trucks are never used to transport much more than a couple bags of groceries.Pressing x for doubt on this onePeople are cargo, we all understand that correctly? The cargo limit included is 1000 lbs, or roughly 2 and a half americans.I thought they might do something like this. Make an average and decent claim during the reveal and then say, "just kidding, those are the figures while loaded." Like telling everyone you're okay at chess and later revealing that you're a Master.Okay, EPA rating was done with 1000 pounds payload . Marques Brownlee has a video on the truck and someone at ford explained to him about the epa rating. He also shows the truck he drove has 360 miles on 80% battery. Which he used to calculate a range above 400 miles at 100%. Yes Ford did knock everyone out of the park. I’ll find the link to the video

Edit: [video](https://youtu.be/J2npVg9ONFo) time stamp 8:20A truck bed offers the ability for a second battery or even a generator to be placed for added range temporarily..It could be on jacks like a truck bed camper and be a rental like a U-haul.Neat. Wonder if it’ll pull a fifth wheel.I've never wanted a truck until I read about the electric version on the f150. I hope I don't fall in love with the country music and guns, when I buy one. Although, do those side effects come with an electric truck? I hope they don't, cause I fucking hate country music and guns.I call BS.Sounds like a poorly managed store with high turnover (lots of greenpeas is a bad sign). They deserve to get roasted in your review.[deleted]Kia dealerships are so bizarre.  It is like a bunch of frat guys negging you to sleep with their weird financing.  I don't think they even sell cars when you go just financing.This one time at a Subaru dealership when I couldn't find a single pre-owned car I wanted on their lot (the car I saw online they just sold apparently), they resorted to numerous tactics to get me to stay and look at various cars of their choosing.

Their final tactic as I was walking out the door?

"I haven't sold a car this month yet I have kids to feed."

Not. My. Fucking. Problem.Woah. Had a very similar experience trying to drive a Stinger. Walked up and looked at one they had sitting on the lot (total of 4 that day), salesman approaches me and does the standard greeting. Asks me "What can I do to get you in this car today?", well, driving it would be a good start. "No problem! Let me make a copy of you license and I'll grab the keys". Cool! 

Guy comes back a few minutes later without anything in his hand and asks me to come inside. "I'm just getting everything approved by my manager before we start anything, come inside and meet him!". Um, no. I just want to drive the car. "Ok, be right back" (Still don't have my license back)

Comes back a few minutes later, still no license. "My manager says we're going to need to see some proof of funds because its a showroom car before you can test drive it, come inside and we can work this out". LOL. Its a Kia, not a new Ferrari. I declined the offer, and asked for my license back. Gave me the run around for a  bit before he finally went back into grab it. Made the mistake of giving him my phone number as I left and I'm not kidding when I say the dealership called me 10 times over the next 4 days, texted twice. Almost all during business hours, even after I'd asked them to quit contacting me. 

For what it's worth, I'm a young dude, but I dress reasonably well and present myself well. Whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth, and I was really looking forward to driving a stinger as a potential next car!Went with my sister to help her look for a new Kia in the DFW area. 

Among many other problems they had,

 - they kept our drivers licenses-

They brushed us off the first couple times we asked for them and when we finally got out and were ~15 miles away we realized they still had our damn cards.

They still fought us when we went back. The freaking nerve. She ended up buying at a car max style place and it was a much better experience. I would have called the police after my second request to have my car keys returned.  I wouldn't have even said a damn thing, just gotten the police on the phone and told them that the car dealership was attempting to steal my car.    

I had some car salesman try to hold my keys as hostage once.  I did not react the way he was expecting, and the Knoxville TN Police became involved quickly.  

The shitty part was that I had bought a brand new WRX from them a year and a half earlier and had had a great experience.  I should have heeded the giant red flag that went up in my head when they told me the salesman and sales manager I had worked with weren't with the dealership anymore. That sounds ridiculous and I kinda wanna go to a KIA dealership to see what it's like now...hmm...maybe that was the point of this post. I see what you're doing KIA shillsYou mention Canal St NYC, This wouldn't happen to be a Kia store in the Westchester area would it?Literally how the Toyota dealership I worked at for a little bit was like.  We were trained to force buyers into a car, bring them to a deserted area for them to test drive their OUTLANDISHLY SPORTY COROLLA S and upon returning to the store force them inside and drop them off to a closer.  Management had listening poles on the lot where the salesmen were stationed (in Florida during 100F+ and rain) and if you didn't say the nonsense they trained you to say you would either be A: immediately terminated or B: reprimanded and scolded that you will never amount to be a closer or anything in the facility.  

"Facts" were to be crafted upon the desires of the customer wherein you must pluck 2 key values they are interested in and completely blow mandatory features on cars out of the water to glorify the brand.  

Maybe I'm just salty that the GM and his 2 sons, who were 1 tier below him on the powerchain, were racist, moneyhungry pigs but still made bank doing literally nothing.  In that time, I learned quickly that I am not cut out to climb the corporate ladder of a giant such as Toyota but to fix business power struggles as a third party company to help the communication between the low tier workers and the decision makers. (I/O psych degree still looking for this type of position please send help) 

Hopefully we can oust dealerships like these of their ability to treat customers like cattle and establish a better connection between consumer and company.

EDIT: I forgot to say -- I mystery shopped at a KIA dealership as part of some training regimen at Toyota and honestly they were super nice people and didn't hound me like everybody else in this thread. Cheers to the dealership I went to I suppose.Can confirm, Kia dealers are massive shitholes. I went into one trying to test drive a Stinger. I walked out 5 minutes later angry. 

After greeting me the salesman asks me "Where are your parents"? I was caught a little off guard by this but I didn't respond. After showing me around the car in the showroom I ask if I can test drive one. He responds by saying "Are you sure you can handle something like this? Do you want to look into something a little more affordable?". I told him I was sure and that I was really interested in this car. He then attempts to steer me over to the Niro in the showroom and suggests I consider it instead. 

I thanked him for his time and walked right the fuck out. 

Edit: Yes I was driving my Z06.I hate it when they try to tell you what they think you want to hear, then the back pedaling they do when they get it wrong.

I was at a Fiat Dealership when the 500 Abarth came out. I was curious about the weight of it. He opens the door, looks at the door plate and proudly states the GVW at something like 3,000lbs. It may be small, but it's a heavy & solid car.  

I say, that can't be right? I was hoping it would be about 2,400lbs, and that was the whole reason I'm interested. He just starts spewing out stuff to try to make me happy. As someone who likes KIA and Hyundai cars, please skewer them and then twist the knife in your review. The last four times I've bought a car the KIA/Hyundai dealerships were my first stop, but never my last stop. Hyundai dealers were just "below average", but with KIA dealers it is like filling the shitty dealership bingo card. The only KIA I've ever successfully purchased was at a Toyota dealer's used lot. A car I would have rather purchased new.

As a secret shopper you should have gone further in the process, it gets worse. Test drive and negotiate for the Stinger GT. Agree on a price and I bet they come back with paperwork for a stinger base model without saying anything and hope you don't notice.You should do an AMA. Interesting job.Poorly managed salespeople seems par for the course with Kia.

My previously leased vehicle, I was cross shopping a bunch of vehicles, one of them being an Optima SX-L. I did not buy one.

I make an appointment with a salesperson, and he is busy when I arrive. I wait. He shows me to an Optima on the floor, base model, and says he'll be right back to pull out the one I was looking for, he just has to show a couple to a vehicle. He is out there for 15 minutes. He takes them on a test drive. I get angry, but go to another salesperson to ask for help. He tells me that he can't help me, as I'm here with [salesperson].

I leave.problem of trying to sell premium/near luxury cars at a budget dealer. you'd be less likely to see this at audi/lexus/bmw/mercoh boy, yeah drop the bomb on them, or at least the douche guyDealer in northern Philly has a k900. I am NOT looking to buy. Coworker bought one. So we go in to pick it up. I give her a ride. She could EASILY buy a Mercedes. I have NO sides why she doesn’t buy a nicer car. Whatever. Mind you. She already bought it and we’re going to PICK IT UP. 

She’s dressed very well. I’m in jeans and t shirt. First people we talk to have no idea the car is even there. They look for it and we are waiting in the showroom and looking at the one on the showroom floor. Going in and out of it. Another salesperson starts chatting her up and then sees me and says “sir, if you want to get in we ask if you can take your shoes off. It’s a luxury car”. No prob. I take them off. Then the salesperson comes back and says they don’t have the car. She says her salesperson called that morning saying it was ready to be picked up. He says who was it. She gives his name. Oooooh. Salesperson gets wide eyed and goes in the back. She follows. Meanwhile I’m playing with the seats and get in the back. Different salesperson starts telling me I need to give him my DL if I want to try the car out. What?  I don’t want to. I’m literally playing with cup holders. I tell him I’m not interested in a test drive. He says “yeah but we have a policy to get a DL if you want to look at a car”. What?  

Coworker comes back. Says the entire sales staff was let go that morning. It’s 5 now. These guys are scrubs from god knows where. They don’t have her car. The GM aid there and is apologizing left and right and then says they will order one for her if she fills out the paparrwork and talks to their finance person. She already paid for it. With a check. It cleared (so she says. Didn’t think that happened till you had the car in hand) but they have NO record of this. Her salesperson was “on vacation” (didn’t he tell you?) and so yeah. 

That was about it. She didn’t come back. Got her money back and is suing (it’s been 8 months since this) to get back some of her money they are billing her for. 

Holy crap. Thanks for your story.

As a non-American I'm curious: why would you ever give your keys to a dealer/salesman?

Is it common practice? What do they do with it? Surely your license copy is enough of a warranty for the test drive for them? Especially when a salesman accompanies you. They should even give your license back before the test ride.[deleted]Now I want to go on my day off coming up and ask to test drive a Stinger, mainly to see if this happens to me and because I am genuinely interested in the Stinger.[deleted]KIA dealerships are just terrible. The stinger honestly don’t deserve to be there..ouch :(

I know your mystery shopping, but there's no way I'd hand over my keys to anybody for nothing.  When I test drove something, they photocopied my license.  I asked for *THAT* back when I left and they were surprised.  "Look, I don't trust you for shit, and I don't what you or anybody having a copy of my license for no reason at at all."  ah the good ole we've got your keys you're trapped techniqueLiterally had the same experience the other week looking for a Stinger.

One dealer would not let me test drive the car unless I committed to buying.  "its a fast car", lol.

Another dealer was perfectly okay with test driving - admittedly had to wait a couple days as they only wanted to test on good weather (in canada).

I mean in the end, the best dealers are gonna make the sale, so i don't really fret about it.Concur. Bought a Kia. Actually had a great sales staff and we love the car but the finance department was scum. i need to buy a car in about a year...not at the moment but soon-ish. Stinger GT was sorta/kinda/maybe on my list of things to check out because of the warranty. I probably will end up going with a wagon or small SUV (2019 volvo v60 mmm mmm) but I was planning to at least test drive the Stinger. 

If it's going to be a giant fucking nightmare to do that I'll just pass since it was near the bottom of the list anyway.My girlfriend had the shittiest test drive experience out here in San Jose trying to look at a Niro. She had a soul and loved it and kia and they single handedly destroyed her want to buy a kia from that dealership. 

in 30 mins the sales guy (who was obviously new, and dressed poorly as well)

-proceeded to talk to me about what she could get on the car and about the car's features, ignoring her. i had no control over what she was buying dude! i said so! 

-texted the whole test drive in the back seat. there were minutes of silence.

-didn't tell her where to go, despite her asking him to specifically

-attempted to adjust the seat to help her get more comfortable without seeming to know how seat adjustment works (she is very small)


She was really uncomfortable at the end and we left quickly. I've been on a lot of test drives and worked at dealerships, that was bottom tier. it really even turned me off considering a stinger. I had someone tell me that I shouldn't be comparing my Kia experience to the experience I had with Audi, which has got to be the single shittiest insult you could give to Kia. Yea, I just dont get why Kia would allow this to happen (and maybe they working toward NOT allowing it to happen, but currently it obviously still is). 

It's one thing to try and use sketchy and cliche car salesman tactics on the soccer mom shopping for that $17k Kia Soul or something (still wrong and incredibly douchey, but still...), but it's a tactic that just plain WILL NOT work on the crowd shopping for $40-50k entry-level luxury vehicles. It will ONLY provide a negative experience to someone who is capable and willing to spend that much on a car. Mercedes, BMW, Lexus, etc would all be failing companies if they used these kinds of selling strategies regularly.

I don't believe Kia is done making $40k+ luxury/sport cars (they have the K900, Cadenza, Stinger, and loaded Optima's already, and I firmly believe a luxury SUV and an even faster/sportier version of the Stinger are right around the corner), but they will not be successful at all if they dont quickly rectify the stigma their sales and service departments currently have. Similar in Ogden Utah. Came from out of state to look at a minivan.  Salesman pushed us through a number of extras that he couldn't/wouldn't explain. Guy was nearly 50 with years of experience. Once we got to finance, the next kid was pointing at papers to sign but not describing what they were in detail. Just called its name. For example, theft protection and environmental protection charges didn't look the same on different papers. Turns out, the theft deterrent system is just bar codes they stuck on before and claim they can't be removed. And environmental protection isn't a government agency requirement. It's a coating to prevent rust. And they have a flashing light or something that allegedly prevents rear-ending. You have to tell them to take it off. They weren't happy when came back the next day to remove $500+ worth of charges that they failed to explain. I had to Google everything. Not the best way to be "Gephardt Approved" out there. Wow.  Complete opposite to my dealer.  Walked in, basically they said "can i help you?"  I was wearing a touque, cheap sweater and crappy sweatpants.

Just a little chat, sat in the stinger, sales guy pointed out a few features i was looking for (seat adjustment, lumbar support, mirror adjustment, trunk release).  Didn't say anything untrue about the car.  Just helped me get comfortable in the seat.

Test drive, let me take it up the local mountain and highways.

Obviously they mentioned the dealer add-ons like undercoat and rust protection and crap.  I said nope, they didn't bring it up again.

If they were pushy like that, i would have walked out, even though i already had my heart set on the stinger.My parents almost bought a Kia in 2001. I remember the salesman kept calling us and dropping the price on the car After the fact my parents bought a Subaru[deleted]To be fair most non-luxury brand dealerships aren’t that much better.How can I become a mystery shopper? I've always to do itI went to a Kia dealership in my town when they first received the Stinger to get a closer look.  I walked in the dealership and not one person said hi or anything, which maybe wasn't a totally bad thing...lol.  Perhaps they were all just busy with customers at the moment.  

One of my best friends has purchased 2 Optimas in the last four years.  I don't remember him saying anything negative about the sales experience.  On his 2015 Optima he hit something metal on the freeway and it punctured the oil pan and blew the engine.  His insurance only wanted to pay for a used engine, but the dealership stepped up and but a brand new engine in it so he was very happy with the service department.  Unfortunately that car ended up crushed by a tree during a tropical storm so that's how he ended up with a 2017 now.To be fair, I imagine most employees at a Kia dealership are inexperienced and trying to cut their chops.  It's like going to a Chili's and saying "I had a bad waiter"... there are plenty of good ones but it's not surprising that there are a lot of inexperienced people there.  

I'm sure most of them would prefer to be working at a BMW or Lexus or even Toyota dealership but they have no credentials.  This probably leads to an *insane* turnover rate at these dealerships (lots of bad salesmen who don't make it; good ones get better jobs quickly) and it's probably next to impossible (not to mention expensive and likely not worth it) to make sure they're all properly trained and actually good at their jobs.> “has a manual transmission” (points to paddles)”,

Oh so he's every craigslist seller with a tiptronic system.Having helped a bunch of friend purchase new cars, I've found that the cheaper the car, the more shithole the dealers tend to be. Most luxury dealers didn't really play much games, sure they'd fudge the money factor a bit and what not, but nothing like selling someone a Civic for $27k OTD when the MSRP is $20k...I've heard things like "the car doesn't have an alarm system so you must buy it" which is ~$2k, protection packages, vin etching, etc. It's awful. And there's always two "levels". You deal with the salesman first, and then the finance manager that tries to mark up other shit again. The finance manager actually got mad at us cause we didn't want their shitty Karr alarm system when my uncle got his accord. Not to mention the shitty install is now causing issues because of monkeys that installed it.


My aunt was trying to buy a base model frontier which is $18k. They were gonna buy it outright, but the dealer said, put $10k down and finance the rest. Payments came out to $300/m for 4 years. Some people would just say "okay" and sign the papers; when you can easily check 300*48=$14.4k+$10k=$24k. Much more than the $18k they negotiated. So I am ASE certified, used to work for GM went through their training, was with them for almost 7 years.
Wife is like. I am pregnant, we need a bigger car.
So... I don't take these decisions lightly.
Took the next 6 months figuring out what to buy.
There is a history of me even asking advice here on reddit.
One guy said get a used Honda Element it was not bad advice.
Anyway we decided that the 23K mitsubishi outlander had every single thing on our checklist that we wanted out of a car for our family to travel long distance.
I don't buy new cars.
So we go into a mitsubishi dealership and say we want THAT car right there. Pointing to a red mitsubishi outlander 2017.
 And we want to pay 16K for it.
The salesman spent 20 mins bragging that he was the best salesman in all of mitsubishi. Then he pulled around a BLACK with black interior 2018 outlander.
I was not amused. They claimed they could do this weird financing thing and we could leave that day paying 18K for that brand new less than 100 miles 2018 outlander.
I called the mitsubishi dealership down the road and told them 
what was happening.
"oh yes we have one on the lot right now come and get it"
So we leave and go there.
They introduce me to a "used car manager" he says I can get any car on planet earth for you, I just tack on a 1,500 dollar finders fee for getting it here for you to buy.
He showed me a dealers only auction website and picked out some red ones that were in 5/5 condition. They were all about 14-15K.
He said I will order one for you and in a week we will have it no problem, I will just add 1,500 bucks.
Ok then.
Week later they call and say come get your car.
We go inspect it and my wife wants a remote start option installed before taking possession and I want rear rim replaced.
We go back two days later and those things are all good.
Now they try to sale us the car for 19K.
I flip the fuck out, we try to leave,  they tell us they can get rid of the 1,500 dollar finders fee bringing it down to 17,500.
I tell them I said 16K and the other dealerships told me that he would sale me a brand new one for 18K.
They say "yeah but it's longer financing..." they then pretend to call the owner and then say they can get 500 dollars off but any lower and people will get fired.  (yeah sure)
I tell them to throw in an interior detail and exterior scratch restore buff out whatever and they have got a deal.
They agree. I bought the car.

WHY DO DEALERSHIPS HAVE TO JERK YOU AROUND?
Why is buying a car like pulling teeth?

And let me tell you something else. We went to a lot of dealerships and saw a lot of cars. We went to a subaru dealership 3 months earlier and there was a green XV fully loaded in the showroom and I was in love with it instantly. 
I would have bought it right then and there if someone would have just given me the paperwork but the salesperson took me away from it, refused to talk about it and tried to force an outback on me just because I originally asked to see an outback.

I would have bought that xv.




[deleted]I was at a Kia dealer and asked the guy if Kia was made in South Korea... he said, “ Yeah, north or south I don’t know. 

edit: key -> kiaI had an incident after college attempting to buy my first car in a Kia dealership. I had saved a ton of money working a summer job and armed with my diploma, for the good student discount. I was prepared to simply buy a sorento, as that was the company car I used at my office job in college and knew all the specs of the car and really didn’t want to put in the work to test drive a million cars. I needed a reliable car to get from point a to point b. 
When I got to the dealership, I was immediately bombarded. I simply stated how much I had as a down payment and how much I preferred to pay a month. No beating around the bush as there was another dealership down the street. The guy starts pushing me to test drive a brand new different model they “just got in last week”. “Just to pass the time” he says. Obviously the car had all the bells and whistles and on the drive I mentioned again what I came there for. 
His tone immediately changed and DEMANDS I drive back to the dealership. 

Fine by me. 

Pulling in, I asked to see the exact model I saw on the website. “Oh we never had that one...” I call bullshit. It was a brand new model of that year. I tell him we can no longer do business ... he relents and decides to get his “big boss manager”. Manager offers to sell me ANOTHER completely different model and year for just $250 more a month. Uh, no. I’m a broke college student...He immediately slams the car door in my face and flips me off, telling me he no longer wants to work with me. 

I was infuriated and vowed to never buy a Kia just from that experience alone. They even had the nerve to bombard my phone and email with apologies still wanting to do business.[deleted]Yeah, I went to KIA looking to buy a Stinger.

Long story short; I pick up my new M240i on Friday.When I hear that he says its a manual and talks about how good it drives, its obvious he'd already taken some liberties with some of the stock there at the expense of the future owners.  > “it has a BMW suspension”   

It's not entirely untrue, they've sniped quite a lot of BMW's staff these days.    

But that sounds like an overall horrible experience. Had a somewhat similar expierience with my local KIA dealership when looking at a Stinger GT2. The sales guy I was working with was actually pretty good though, he was fairly knowledgable about the car, let me test drive it with no questions asked (20+ miles actually), and was generally a very laid back guy.

The trouble started when we got back to the dealership and we started talking numbers. He wanted my social right away, which I immediately stopped and asked what for. He wanted to do a credit pull before we even talked about the price of the car, etc.

The problem was, they wanted a $5k markup on top of MSRP. I told him I wouldn't let him run my credit until we got that taken care of. Next thing you know, the dealership owner is stopping by. 

I straight up tell him I will buy it today at MSRP (knowing tons of people are getting them below MSRP, but w/e), with no markup. He refuses to budge. Says they are hot ticket items that are made by the former BMW / Audi designer, they are better than BMWs / Audis, they aren't going to depreciate much in 3 years, etc.

I reiterated that if the markup was taken off, I'd buy it right then and there. Still refused to budge, so I left.

A lot of what he was spouting was not true; it seems they're just throwing out random facts like the Stinger is suddenly better than BMWs / Audis rather than letting the car speak for itself. 

I guess this is working for people that don't know cars, but he would have made a sale that day if he had dropped the damn markup. I think KIA is not prepared to sell these cars to enthusiasts that actually research the car as well as have a general idea about the luxury car market.[deleted]Fuck KIA salespeople. My experience was not as bad but pretty awful. Jackass salesman lets me sit in a car for a few seconds then instantly drags me inside and tries desperately to get my personal info to run numbers. He was offering some outrageous lease amount for their cheapest car, the forte, $400/month with $2k down. Riiiiiiiiight buddy. I had to raise my voice to get him to stop and the manager noticed and came over. All the idiot manager did was continue the bullshit speal until I interrupted him to let him know I had not even taken  a test drive yet and what outrageous of a rip off deal his salesman was trying to pull on me. “Wellllll” ... fucking scumbags. Not just Kia dealerships. I worked for a company that had car dealerships as customers.


This "hold your keys, license, car hostage" thing is common. NEVER give those up. They'll offer to wash your car for free, assess it for a trade-in, or move it somewhere you can't find it. Nope. They can make a copy of your license for the test drive. Don't leave it in their hands. Be ready to walk at any time. 

This reminds me of a time I was looking at an RX-8 at a dealership and the guy told me it had a V6 and got great gas milage lol. This sounds more like a dealerships are scum bag situations than a Kia problem. I recently went to test drive a VW Golf GTI and the guy gave me the same type of run around. 

To be fair, two of his claims were accurate-ish. The lead chassis engineer was Albert Biermann, who not only has a fabulous name, but was the head of BMW's M Division for some time.

It is also faster than some supercars.... From the 1980s and 1990s. I work retail and that sort of behavior would get me retroactively fired since 1950.and then there was the day my mom, in her 50's and a NYC commercial real estate broker (think millions) was told to "come back with her husband" for a small sportscar.  They didn't sell.
When you go to a dealership look for a sales person in their 40s or 50s that’s been at it forever, preferably a woman. Doesn’t matter what brand. New or used.

They aren’t arrogant, they aren’t out to screw you. They don’t try to pretend they know everything about cars or get in dick measuring contests. They just want to help you pick a car that works for you, and get their normal commission. If the car you want isn’t the one they have they give you their card and ask you to look them up if you decide you do want something you drove there.

If you end up at a dealership and there are no people in sales older than 30, fucking run man. It means they’re hiring anyone with a pulse willing to do anything to make a sale.I think Kia/Hyundai make a damn good car for the money. The KDM market by and large offers the best value of any automotive segment

Admittedly, high pressure sales tactics and salespeople who try and pretend to know what they're talking about are my biggest annoyances when it comes to buying a car. The whole business about "Turbo supercharged" and "Manual transmission" while pointing to paddle shifters would be enough to make me run far, far away from that dealer. As an automotive enthusiast, that shit irks me to no endI went into a KIA dealership in 2015 with the intention of buying a new car.  That was my ONE focus that day. I knew it could take a few hours but I didn’t care.  I told the saleswoman that the only thing I wanted was to have a lower payment than what I currently had.  

The first car she runs the numbers on is a top of the line $48k Sorento.  Almost double my current payment.  She tried to keep pressing me saying “you deserve this”.  I gave up right then and there and left.  

I mean c’mon how do sales people talk someone out of buying a new car?!  

It’s like they use every old trope in the book.  Like “I like you, so here’s what I can do”.  

Needless to say, I haven’t gone back and I like their cars.  Just a heads-up, this post triggered the salty losers over at /r/askcarsales when it was crossposted there.

https://www.reddit.com/r/askcarsales/comments/82ltjb/guy_mystery_shops_kia_dealer_and_they_get_his_keys/> I show the manager my badge


What badge?The dealership i purchased my stinger was fine. They pulled the car out of the showroom without a second thought, gave me the keys for a test drive. They took 10min to get a trade in value on my car and brought my keys back to the table. My sales guy set me up with a free loaner while my windows got tinted a week later. Overall not the worst place to buy a car, would probably buy again from same dealership.How is it a "test drive" when youre forced to buy the car afterwards? That's such a huge red flag. If any car dealer ever said anything like that to me I'd walk out right then.For what it's worth, I was pretty sure that I wanted to buy an Optima and in less than 15 minutes the Kia dealership managed to completely talk me out of buying a Kia for the rest of my life.This post has motivated me to go fuck with a KIA dealership today after work. Thanks!Jesus Christ. I work in finance at a dealer and was sales for a few years and have never seen anything even close to that go down. The sad thing is that I totally believe your story. I know dealers still pull stunts like that and unfortunately it's not as rare as I would like to think. 

There are plenty of dealers who would never allow that kind of behavior from sales people. I'm very careful about who I work for, which is probably the main reason I'm even in the business still. It makes me sick how many scumbags fuck up the industry for the rest of us. 

After 5 years in the business I've helped at least 1000 customers buy a vehicle either as a sales person or in finance. A large majority have told me, unsolicited, that I helped provide the absolute best experience they have ever had and they are shocked that car buying can be enjoyable and comfortable. 

That's obviously a huge compliment and makes the job very rewarding. At the same time it's really sad how surprised people are when they are treated with respect and offered help and transparency. I do my job and do it well and give good customer service. That's it. That's nothing special at all. I'm not some kind of elite super-human prodigy. 

In the past year I've made at least 10 customers cry because I just did my fucking job and was a decent human being. A few cried because I was the first person to really try to help them when they were in a rough spot. Sometimes they went through a rough patch like a bad divorce or they lost their job and it destroyed their credit and the last three dealers shamed them and treated them like lowlifes. Sometimes they were buying for the first time after the death of their spouse and were terrified of being fucked over and when they weren't the relief was overwhelming. Whatever it was, I never take for granted what I am in a position to do for someone. Fuck people who throw away the opportunity to make an impact like that. 

Sometimes I go a little further to do what's right and sacrifice something small. Maybe I lose $200 or $300 on a warranty or bank fee if it's a huge benefit to the customer. I've lost $500 gross profit to save a single mother $100/month. I cut out all my warranty profit so I could match a bank approval that was 7% APR Instead of 18%. I didn't need to and I don't expect other people to, but I still feel good thinking about it. That's worth a lot more than $75 in commission. I work for people who back those kind of decisions because it's less money now, but comes back tenfold. If I can do things like that and still have higher than average numbers and still bring home bigger paychecks, then I'm doing something right.


I went way off track there, but it feels good to remember why I do what I do. For every person I help, there's just as many problems. Bounced checks, stolen socials, fake ID's, fraudulent credit applications, dodged calls, endless lies, whatever. But it's not that bad at the end of the day. It's nothing compared to people who actually dedicate themselves to make a difference in the world. I guess what I'm saying is that you literally don't need to do anything at all to make a huge difference. You just have to not be a shitty person. There's no advantage to any of those fucking games and there's no excuse. 

My biggest personality flaw is directly related to my best. I have a major anger problem. I'm known to go off and read my sales people the riot act if they piss me off. I don't take shit and I won't accept excuses. But the ONLY things that I ever get angry about are dishonesty and bad customer service. You can back a truck in to my car and spill paint on my Jimmy Choo purse and I won't raise my voice and will accept a sincere apology. But if you refuse to test drive someone before running their credit because you don't "think" they can buy the car, then I'll gladly correct the apparent misconception that your age, attire or career makes you better than anyone. Usually in a way that's a little more abrasive.... A lot more abrasive actuallyThere’s a Kia dealer near me who just yells into the radio and constantly cuts off his wife saying it’s “HUGE-A!”...he seems litToyota did this shit to me when I went to look at their top model Camrys. Held my keys hostage, and "lost" my car (they parked it behind a small building). Fuck dealerships who do this shady shit.This is pretty much what I went though, though a little less intense, when I bought my Si and when I went to look at the 2018 Accord. They do almost anything to keep you on the lot. Hell, when I went with my wife to look at the Highlander they were dicks about my credit and then didn’t want to give me my keys back when I (truthfully) told them I had to go home and take **heart medicine**.

With the Si they kept making shit up or talking about crap I didn’t care about. With the Accord the guy actually left me alone because I was telling my wife the sales pitch. Still you could tell he didn’t want me to get away.

I will most likely be using a car buying service for my next purchase. Probably USAA’s. It’s not worth the nonsense.I once had a salesman try to hold my keys hostage. I called the police non emergency number asking to make a complaint of being held against my will. They got my keys back to me right quick. [deleted]Car dealerships suck. I just bought a new pickup and was told repeatedly they had to run numbers with me to make me aware of my options, I was paying cash outright. Stupid bastard lost a sale because he wouldn't just sell me the truck.I think this is why Tesla is so appealing: There's no dealerships.I scrolled thru the commwnts and didn't see this. This is entrapment. This is used by dealerships to try to pressure you into a sale. CALL THE COPS. Press charges on everyone involved. 

I sold cars for a hyundai and ford dealership for a while and they have training regarding this. They tell you that if you plan on keeping your job don't do any of these actions.This is pretty much every car dealer experience I've had in my life besides at a Mercedes dealer. Maybe it's a "classy" establishment, but every dealer I've been to for the lower end has been just like this. Honda, Ford, Kia, Dodge, this is why I hate the dealership experience. Mercedes (shopping for used) was pretty much "tell me what you want, if we don't have it come back when we do" but not in a bad way, and there was pretty much zero pressure, didn't ask for social or stupid things like keys (which I wouldn't give even if they asked) no talking us into a different car "well this one is beige, that's pretty much silver" none of that. Genuinely fine experience.It's really annoying when dealers put "manual transmission" and its a fucking game of "lets see if they put a pic of the shifter to see if they're bullshitting me or not".

Like, could it kill you to just call them paddle shifters? They're not bad. They're just not manual cars.I'll start by saying thank you so much OP for posting this experience and getting the rants going!

My SO and I purchased our first Kia Rio 5 in 2013 and have NEVER experienced a company worse than Kia when it comes to customer service.

I am so glad I have this great opportunity to rant as well.  Our nightmares NEED to be shared with the rest of you.

As a prelude to the lengthy next bit that's about to come, I will say this; I want Kia to disappear! That's how terrible of a company they are.

I will lay out as many of our bad experiences that I can remember in chronological order leading up to the very recent and most defining last one.

1. Bought our car in early January 2013. Financing option wasn't the issue at all. The car came with factory installed tint. A welcome touch (or so we thought). We also bought the extended bumper to bumper warranty (8y, 160k).

2. Within a month, the rear right bumper reflector lens falls out without any known impact.  I take it in and am charged over $200 to replace.

3. A week later I am called by the dealer and asked to come in for an unscheduled minor recall issue.  Turns out my car didn't come with the right floor matts.

4. A week or two later the aforementioned tint starts peeling off the driver window.  I schedule an appointment to bring it in. They tell me the tint guy is outsourced and can only perform the service on Saturdays when they open (7 or 8 am).  I get there only to find out the tint guy is late.  I wait 2 hours and he never shows.  The GM apologizes and tells me he will get the tint guy to come to my house and do the job outside. I doubted him right away (it was winter) but for some naive reason, I gave him the benefit of the doubt.

5. Later that week the dealership calls me to confirm my thoughts. The tint guy can only do it at the shop AND I still need to accommodate his schedule.  I come in again and leave the car to get the tint done.

6.  When the job is done I ask if all the windows were redone and am told there is no need. One of the salespeople says eight to me that that is BS and I should expect more tint to peel. The dealer still won't do anything unless something else peels.

7. Less than a month later 2 more windows start to peel. Also, the manual transmission seems to be making a weird sund when in low gears.

8. I bring the car in unscheduled on a weekend and while waiting for the dealer to bring my car in for service, the GM finds me and asks me why I'm there again.  I bring him to the car to show him and he right away tells me I have a lemon or a bad luck car. He reminds me that I originally wanted the higher trim model (SX) and in black (I settled for some ugly orangey color). When I had originally purchased, those options weren't available but that day, the exact one I wanted was sitting on the lot new.

9. The GM gets me out of the old into the new the same day.  This was my first/second car purchase and unfortunately I wasn't diligent enough when making the switch. I hadn't realized until it was pointed out to me a couple years later, that the GM had burried the negative equity off the trade in right into my financing agreement.

10. I ask the GM for a $500 gas card for everything I've been through and he agrees I deserve one but says there is nothing he can do about it and suggests I call Kia Canada (yes this was in Canada. A bigger hint is that it was in Ontario), and speak to the customer experience department.  He even tells me to involve him and he will back me up.

11. I call Kia Canada and tell my story to the correct department.  My case is instantly escalated to the head of this department.  She and I spend days going back and forth arguing as she investigates the case.  She eventually even acknowledges that the GM made the suggestion and stands by me but still says no. She and the GM start "battling it out" until the GM returns to me and says he can't help.  Its basically out if his jurisdiction.  He tells me to call back one final time and put up a real fight.

12. I call the head of the customer experience department for all of Canada and at this point she is so frustrated by our week long back and forth a that she ends it with a final......"FUCK OFF!". You read that right. The head of Kia Canada's customer experience department spewed those words out and put the nail in the coffin with that.

13. We decided to move on and just enjoy our new car.

14. About 8-9 months into ownership, one exteremly cold winter night after working outside for 8 hours (valet parking for an event), the car konks out about 1km from my house. I push it all the way to our driveway and use our seemingly fantastic warranty to have the vehicle towed to the dealer. To avoid going through the headaches we suffered with the last car, I have it towed to a different, much further dealer.  Someone I knew who also owned a Kia and agreed the dealer I bought the car from stunk, said he'd had much better experience with this one.

15. I go to the dealer and find out that the yaw rate sensor and one other sensor were malfunctioning and not allowing the fuel to make it to the motor.  They would have to be replaced but were not in stock. So now leaving the car this far away and not being able to come home with it the same day seemed stupid.  So I had them bring it back to the original dealer to make my life easy.

16. Once it gets to the other dealer they indicate that the entire diagnosis needs to be done again because each dealer is independent and regardless of the results they share, it must be done by them. FINE!

17. Over the next few years I tried avoiding all dealerships for all regular maintenance and was pretty successful in doing so. However, eventually, I began to notice the fuel consumption increasing drastically. I tried 2 other Kia dealers in my area in my endeavour to find a good one and experienced the same crap eevrywhere.

18. As well, over the years I've had to replace the backup camera and entire NAV unit as they too became defective.

18. When it came to the fuel consumption issue, that battle was lost when the head mechanic showed me a chart created by Kia that showed that there was an acceptable range for fuel consumption and my car was still in it. The range was ridiculously huge and once again, Kia got their way.  Today, I get an average of 330km to a tank.  I barely drive it for the last 18 months though on the count of working from home since.

19. Fast forward to about 1 month ago.  I went to my dealer because the transmission was slipping, the rear left caliper was leaking, and both shock bushings were worn and needed replacing.  I found this out while getting a safety check which I obviously did not pass. If anyone is wondering, yes, I have been 1000% on top of all scheduled maintenance.  As well, I thought to mention that both front seatbelts were no longer retracting and the drivers side door and gear shifters paint had been coming off over the years. I was hoping all this would be covered by my amazing warranty.

20. I come in for the diagnosis and they tell me that my warranty is 3rd party and not offered by Kia anymore. They aren't sure what it covers by they believe it is the best one and even better than their current warranties.  The first thing they discover is that there is a $250 deductible per claim. So, to avoid having me make 2 separate claims, they indicate that the first plan of attack is to perform a transmission fluid flush to see if the slipping goes away. If after a week it seems okay, then they will put the claims in without the transmission. However, if after the flush nothing changes, they will submit with.

21. I show them the exact maintenance schedule I've been following that was provided to me by them when I first bought the car and point out that it does not indicate my car ever needs a flush.  They say I'm actually about 40k km past due but it won't affect my warranty because I was in fact never told this is required.  They charge me the usual dealer rip off rate to do something my car apparently didn't need.

22. The issue goes away and after a week of driving the car, I call the dealer back to tell them to file the claim without a transmission job.

23. The dealer gets back to me a week later and indicates that the caliper and shocks are covered but not the seatbelts or paint. Great warranty! If mine is one of the best, how does it get worse from here?

24. I bring the car in for the warranty work and this is where things get so sour, we posted a Yelp review about this experience.  Now you get to hear about to too!  This next experience was the deciding factor of whether or not we renew our loan agreement after maturity this April and enjoy the extended warranty until the km run out or buy something else.I'm driving at night on a rural road. There's a car going the other direction with lights so bright that I can barely see. I flash my lights. Turns out that he didn't have brights on. As a revenge, he turns them on. They shine brighter than a thousand suns. I go blind.

I played myself too many times this way.> The recall involves F-150s from the 2018 through 2020 model years that are equipped with optional LED headlights. The problem stems from the headlight switch software. When drivers turn on their low-beam headlights manually, the switch fails to also dim the truck’s daytime running lights. As a result, both are illuminated at the same time, so the lights can be too bright for other drivers, increasing the risk of a crash. This problem doesn't occur when the switch is left in the “Auto” position.Now do the Super Duty with it’s 4 headlights#[ ——— ]You know whose lights are actually really bright? Current gen Hondas. Civics, Accords, Odysseys, they are all freaking bright. And Teslas.About fucking time. I legit lose years off my eyesight whenever one is behind me at night.If people are flashing their brights at you then you should get the headlight alignment checked.Besides f150's; i find the '17+ Silverado headlights blinding.That’s funny, I’ve never had an issue with the F-150 headlights. But the F-250/350? Holy crap. What’s the deal with [these quad headlights?](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tY0GpvPshUo/maxresdefault.jpg) How and why do these exist? I thought vehicles can only have 2 headlights, not 4. And also, they’re bright as fuck.[deleted]**I have a serious question - are our eyes less sensitive to the slightly yellowish halogens?** 

Because I get legit blinded by the newer bluish white headlights. And if it is on a pickup truck, then I am done for driving a sedan. It's gotten so bad that I have sometimes stopped taking a 2 mile shorter backroad to my house at night, and would rather take the longer route and stop at a light rather than being blinded several times on the way home.This might be an unpopular opinion, but having driven many newer cars with factory LED headlights, I vastly prefer the stock HIDs in my TL. They just seem to spread the light so much better without blinding everyone else.Isn’t this the same truck that failed to get an IIHS top safety pick because of the headlights not being bright enough?Remember when car headlights weren't as bright as all the suns in the galaxy combined.Best thing about my new Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV is how good the LED headlights are... but even better, they have a headlight adjustment inside the car with 5 different levels.  People flashing you a lot?  Just lower it one or two points.  Carrying a lot of people or a heavy load, lower it a few points.  Highway driving by yourself?  Crank it all the way up.

All vehicles should have this.There legitimately needs to be legislation regulating the brightness of new car headlights (and retroactive,  if i had it my way)As someone that drives a low and small car. I hate almost every new SUV or Truck on the road with their headlights blinding me through through my mirrors.FUCKING FINALLY ITS STARTING. I have a condition where I have very large open pupils that dont close all the way. This gives me great night vision but also makes it insanely hard to see when these new headlights hit me. I end up blind for a few seconds half the time. Never was a problem till these new bright lights started happening the last few years. Those and the white hallogen or whatever they are lights.TBH there needs to be a new luminosity cap on headlights because if Honda's aren't too bright i don't know wtf the cap is at currently other than "brighter than the sun" as a description.Remember years back, where we would all put HIDs in reflector housings and be considered giant assholes because of the glare?

The OEMs have outdone us. Both my 80s and 90s Ford trucks have HIDs in them, and they are downright easy on the eyes compared to new cars!Yeah, I drive a really low car..Had to get my windows tinted very dark in order to not get blinded.i walk the dog late at night along a fairly busy road and have to look down at the ground because some cars on coming lights are just retarded bright to a point if im looking at them its irritating and its washes out the surroudings.

&#x200B;

I also have illegally dark tints on my car and its been the first time i have not had any issues with other car lights bouncing from my mirrors into my eyes at stop lights etc. which has actually been a really refreshing change.

&#x200B;

edit: also some lights are so bright i noticed it washes out the blinkers until you get really closeI feel like bright lights in general are a trend nowadays and it is annoying as fuck. Can't see shit at night with more than 3 cars behind me or coming my way.This needs to apply to the F250's as well. Damn trucks are searing my retinas!And I thought people weren't dimming their lights.Great, please do the Chevy Equinoxes next.I’ve got the previous gen f150 which also has crazy bright LEDs. 

I’ve adjusted the aim on them so they’re below the side mirrors of the car in front of me at a stop. I also run parking lights as DRLs to be less annoying. 

A lot of guys have these highly glaring LEDs with levelled truck too, and they don’t bother adjusting the aim, and they blind everyone and enjoy it. While they’re at it, 24/7 fog lights too.[Everybody liked that]Fuck yes they are, almost all new cars seem to be this wayWell Christ on a stick, I guess there *is* a God!Cue the most widely ignored recall in history.Headlights being too bright is a serious issue.  If a driver in oncoming traffic cant see, you're more likely to be hit than if you had more reasonable headlights.  I'm not a fan.I have a halogen equipped 2019 F150 and the leds are the one option I wish I had on my truck.  The headlights are so bad when I first used them, I thought they were broken.  It is like holding two bic lighters in front of the truck.FUCKIN NICEIt’s about fucking time!Low beam brightness is getting ridiculous with all manufacturers.I had assumed being a douchebag was a design feature of the F150This needs to happen more. It's honestly getting insane.As a trucker, thank god. Half the time when someone is blinding me from behind it’s just an F series.Good. Tired of being blinded by new cars. The F-150 is far from the only offender.Recently I’ve been wearing sunglasses at night and it’s done wonders for my eyes. Yeah the darks are darker but the brights are so much more bearable.T H A N K,,, F U CK I N G GOOODDDDTwo different times, I have actually flashed my lights in my patrol car at these stupid trucks because I felt like I was staring into the sun as they passed. Pretty sure I felt heat one time. Absolutely ridiculous. It’s actually very dangerous and Ford dropped the ball not checking this stuff. How does no one notice the running lights weren’t switching off?! That would make me feel super confident buying one of these 60k train wrecks. Glad they are having to fix this.Ford finally does something too wellOh... sure!  Pick on the F-150.  *squints at Toyota Corolla Factory LED headlights.

I blame the NHTSA for their headlight rating system, I think Ford said... ok, you want good headlights!!?  How’s the power of 1000 suns?I think that a lot of commenters may have not read the article, because they're "too bright" based on the assessment of "Daytime Running Lights are on simultaneously as LowBeam", not in regards to LowBeam intensity.Possibly unpopular opinion:

This recall should be expanded to include more years, more models and *more brands*.Thank God. Every time I have a night class, I'm blinded by these damn things in particular.I don't think brightness is an issue, they just need to be aimed / adjusted properly off the lineAlso 2019 f-350, mine was recalled for the same reason.In the meantime, those yellow tinted "Night driving" glasses do actually help in my humble opinion.THIS!  Also for people who have these death trap headlights and then decide to lift their vehicle, please adjust your headlights properly! My fiancé got in a bad wreck because someone’s lights on the other side of the interstate blinded her since they didn’t bother to adjust them after getting their truck lifted.Apparently nobody in here has had a newer F250 or F350 drive behind them or towards them.

Those LED headlights are like 8bn candlepower and seriously dangerous.YES. FINAL-FUCKING-LYDucking finally! Damn near blind in my left eye as a result of these fuckers!Thanks. Now do it with literally every other truck, please.Number of truck owners getting \*THAT\* fixed, ZERO.This made me so happy. There needs to be a test and a ticket given out for cars which exceed a certain number of lumens.Its a voluntary recall none of them will get it done.ITT: Reddit pretends it knows more about LED headlights than the car industry as a whole, ignores the real reason of the recall to discuss LED headlights being too damn bright."Thank fuck" - civic guy. Not by choice but by affordabilityGonna hop on to say STOP PUTTING GODDAMN LEDS IN YOUR HEADLIGHTS IF THE CAR STARTED WITH INCANDESCENTS.

the mirrors and lens used to diffuse the light are design with these types in mind. LEDs emit different light strengths at different wavelengths, putting an LED in an incandescent makes your light dangerously bright. It's also illegal in most countries, though rarely knownRecall every suv every car with their new LEDs cuz they're so dam bright. Also car brands shod stop selling auto high beam dmmart adjust type tech because dumbasses leave the car in high beam and these systems aren't that smart imhor/notbaldtires[removed]But can Ford fix the problem where 75% of F-150 owners do not use turn signals to change lanes?That’s everyone’s car in the USA goneHow the hell is this the only car being recalled for that ? BMW learn from this shit ( yes your shitty minis too BMW)But what do I do when someone behind me has their high beams on and has no fucking clue and is literally just blinding everyone in front of them?I’m in Georgia where everyone drives a jacked up truck and they purposely put the brightest lights in that they can and drive 1 millimeter from your rear bumper and flash them at you.  Don’t expect anyone here bringing in their truck for this recall.I agree that these lights are too bright, but I doubt many people will go to the shop to have their headlights dimmed.Finally!!!I am so glad to know that it isn’t the drivers fault. Even just yesterday I wanted to run one of the f350s off of the road. Damn those things are bright. It had just turned dusk so I bet they switched the lights on themselves.There has to be some range rovers with this to. It's either the range or it's another type of Ford SUV. Always getting blinded by some modern SUVsI live in the middle of bumfuck no-where, and I mean almost everyone has an F series, lifted. Every night I get flash banged by some F series, then I feel bad for driving our F series at night because some poor dude in a honda civic is getting flash banged trying to stay on the already fucked up roads we have. I mean, personally I’m used to it, but yeah they are pretty fricken bright.It's almost every new car

I bet all major car manufacturers are spending money to keep the complaints buried 

Just another way money buys you convenience at the expense of others 

Anyone have a petition I can sign?Fuckin finally, I swear this trend of making headlights brighter than a hundred Suns had got to end. As someone who drives a coupe it's goddamn terrifying to be blind for several seconds on a dark highway in the middle of nowhereThank God I thought I was oversensitive or something! These trucks hit lower vehicles so bad it's so obnoxiousThank God!About bloody time.I could have fucking told you that.

Hopefully all the other manufacturers follow suit.Good.  Now if they could position them correctly too, and not at eye level of a driver in a standard vehicle.It's about goddamned timeTHANK YOU.Jesus fucking Christ thank God. This shit drives me nuts. Their head lights need to be bannedWe are looooong past the point of "too bright"
Every modern car is brutal. My pitiful Ranger can barely light up 10 ft in front of me.

Driving with those bright headlights is fantastic though.It’s about time!I’ve read that the law is by wattage and now that there are LED’s and others there are more lumins now. So the law needs revamping to fit new standards.

Damn some new cars are hella bright, and while I was a jeep guy at one point, fuck you jeep guys, oh H3’s in there, blind everyone! Mostly pavement pounders around my parts anyway.Good it's a hazardI've decided my next car is going to be a truck simply because I want to be higher off the ground and not be as blinded by headlightsI'm glad I'm not the only one noticing that, those C-shaped Ford pickup lights are too damn bright.Most trucks light only seem bright because of their height. Them Toyota lights are bright.Thank fucking god, from someone who drives a low car these lights burned holes in my retinas at night!They need to approve those fancy European DLP projector [headlights](https://www.engadget.com/2017/09/21/mercedes-digital-light-smart-headlights/) for use here in the US.I thought I was getting old and my eyesight was failing me. I’m 34.

I have the solution! 

If they are behind me I position my side mirrors so it reflects their light back into their eyes. 

I always have eggs in my car for the asshole going the other way.

Side note: I heard if they get caught with off road bar lights on while being on the road, the police will give them a fine for each individual bulb that is on. This gets hella expensive!Not sure if you the US have them but in Europe the new Minis with the brand new headlights (circular design) are absolutely blinding and aimed far too high.Thank fucking god! I drive a challenger so I already sit low and EVERY time trucks roll up behind me (not just Ford) and they have LEDs I'm blindThis is every new car. New Toyota Camry headlights and any Lexus are insanely bright as well.It's about fucking time. They're usually not adjusted properly, either, but the same can be said of a lot of vehicles I encounter on the road.Auto manufacturers jumped on led tech as fast as they could and went super nova with the brightness. The laws have yet to catch up. We need nationwide regulations to ban the new brightness levels and force recalls to cut most of the new lights brightness down to about 20-30 % of what they were sold as. 

It’s just absurd anymore. The combine of super bright lights and every vehicle being taller is bad enough. As a slight incline or offset and everyone gets blinded by this crap.Gm next pleaseWhy are these bright lights not illegal in other cars for fuck sake nothing like being blinded by the light of a thousand suns and nearly crashingOh shit it’s the lights!! I thought it was the blaring of small dick energyF-150 isn’t the only model that needs an adjustment, Ford isn’t the only brand.Holy hell thank god. Idk if any states do this, but I’ve been saying NJ needs to start inspecting headlights during state inspection. Angle and brightness...far too many people have blinding headlights. There's a car going the other direction with lights so bright that I can barely see. I flash my lights. Turns out that he didn't have brights on. As a revenge, he turns them on. They shine brighter than a thousand suns. I go blind.Feels like every new car has lights that are too bright.A light bar on the car is the solution guys. Turn it on whenever someone is trying to blind you from the front, blind them instead.Imagine having them directly behind you in the rain headlights bright as hell fire trying to go 80 I fucking hate em all of em lolThey ironically don't even have that great of throw for the f150 drivers, they're just hoisted up high and pointed directly in the eyes of anyone in a car.Can they do something about the bell ends that put the million candle watt light bar on the front of their trucks?But they can’t recall the 5.0 engines for piston slap, timing chain rattle and oil consumptionAbout time, trucks sit higher off the ground and if new cars are able to blind drivers then trucks really would too. 
Most states have laws protecting drivers from vehicle modifications that place headlights, taillghts or bumpers too high off the ground. So if a lifted truck is blinding you, call the cops.Pretty sure they were going to get some Ebay HIDs anyways. Just saved them the time.FinallyTHANK YOU!!!not only too bright but way up high so they are pointed right at your rear window and mirrors.Another issue is height and where they're directed. Even regular lights fuck me up in the rear view when they are 4 feet high and not pointing downward.I think all cars since 2016 or so should be recalled for this. Can't see jack shit at night if anyone's driving anything larger than a coupe/sedan.I don’t think their turn signals work either. Have yet to see a truck with working directional here in ArizonaTall vehicles with bright lights are the absolute worst thing when you're in a sedanSo when are they going to recall the wranglers?I can totally get behind this. My grandfather had Alzheimers but there was legally nothing the system could do to prevent him from driving because his muscle memory and driving habits over 60 years just allowed him to drive a car like a robot with zero thought. He never knew where he was but they couldn't take his license away because he was still fully capable of operating the car safely.

After getting calls from the police a half dozen times because he would get trapped in a neighborhood and circle the streets for hours my dad had to physically disable his car so he could no longer leave. 

The problem is the current tests are almost completely physical in nature. There needs to be a psychological element at a certain age threshold."You have already supported this petition" 

Uhh, no I haven't? Do I wake up in the middle of the night as an elderly concerned Tyler Durden? This is great news! This needs to be done in America so badly. I kinda think it should be a requirement every time you renew, just the basics. I had to test on all the street signs when I renewed my license last month and I'm 36. Things like blinker, horn, merging, PUTTING DOWN THE FUCKING PHONE should all be tested. Oh are we doing this? Awesome.

I think this petition should include not allowing groups of sneniors released to the road all at the same time. Make them leave dinner or concerts in stages. I think in the U.S it's far too easy to get a license, people don't really understand that they're in control of a 1.5+ ton killing machine. Should be done for everyone everytime you renew your license. [deleted]Only if this also goes hand in hand with increasing the driver training and testing requirements for all new drivers. That would do a lot more to increase safety than this to be honest.

Stories of that 72-year-old bad driver you encountered do not disprove this any more than your uncle telling you "Hey it was warm in February this year" debunks climate change. You shouldn't only care about statistics when they support what you kneejerk believe anyway. 

Reddit's demographics make these statistics hard to accept though, I realize.Is this not a UK thing?

Get off my roads!


**Car Crash Statistics Based on Age**

Teens = Highest Risk Group: For every mile driven, teens between the ages of 16 and 19 are four times as likely to be involved in a car crash
    
Teenage Car Fatalities: 5,000 teens in the 16 to 20 age group die each year as a result of a car crash
    
Teenage Car Injuries: 400,000 teens in the same age group are injured each year in car accidents
    
Disproportionate Population / Fatality Ratio: Teens make up 10% of the population but represent 12% of car crash fatalities
    
Cost: 30% or $26 billion per year in costs are accounted for by drivers under the age of 24
    
Driving Habits: Teenagers are more likely to speed, tailgate and only 10% report wearing seatbelts
    
Teen Male Drivers: Of male drivers ages 15 to 20 killed in car crashes, 38% were speeding and 24% were under the influence of alcohol
    
High Risk Age Groups: People between the ages of 15 and 24 and over 75 are the groups most likely affected by car accidents
    
Senior Drivers: Drivers over the age of 65 are second most likely to die in a car crash
    
Safety Disparity: Despite the fact that older drivers are on average slower, safer drivers, they are more likely to die in a car accident than younger drivers

 
**Car Crash Statistics Based on Location**
    
Rural Danger: There are about 30% more car crash fatalities in rural areas than in urban areas
    
Deer Collisions: About 150 people die and 10,000 people are injured every year due to collisions with deer which roam rural and less densely populated areas
    
Run-off Road Collisions: Over 31% of all U.S. car-related fatalities are caused by vehicles running off of the road, an event more likely to happen along highways or where there is a steep shoulder
    
Newark, NJ: According to Allstate Insurance, people are more likely to be involved in a car crash in Newark, NJ than anywhere else in the nationWhy stop there? There are plenty of people between 16 and 70 that have no fucking clue how they should be driving their car. I say refresher course every time you renew your license.They need refresher courses every 10-15 years in my opinion. The amount of just plain bad drivers on the road grows everyday because our driving standards in the States are terrible compared to the rest of the world. The shameful thing is we think driverless cars are the way out of this problem instead of simply raising the standards for getting a license to drive. The amount of people I see driving who just should not be on the road seems to grow everyday.Here is the correct link I hope.

https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/190793/sponsors/ov9LHXCyphQegkySrIJGood luck trying to argue this with that generation. 'I was a tank drivers in WW2 before you were born sonny!'Absolutely no politician will ever touch this subject because the electoral systems are biased toward retirees.Yeah they need to but maybe 75, my dad is approaching 67 and still working every day, his healths fine etc and he doesent really look over 50. Whereas you get others approaching 70 who are fucked and knocking on heavens door, 75 to 80 is when people start to deteriorate. Good luck, won't happen.  Old people have money and old people vote.How about even younger?!How about a refresher course very 5 years for everyone?  Some of the worst drivers aren't that old.I want a refresher course for all people. They literally change the driving rules and laws but don't teach anybody then act surprised when people make mistakes. I'd take self driving cars first though, I didn't realize how much I hate traffic until I started working from home part time.When I drive, it's not the geezers that are the problem, it's the phone text and talkers. Hell on a biker. Hang the F*** UP and drive!A lot of hate for the oldersters. A lot of anecdotes, many second and third hand.

But is there any actual empirical evidence that older drivers cause proportionally more collisions than young drivers? I'm guessing young drivers are much more dangerous per capita; teens have better reflexes but worse judgment.

No, I'm not 70. I'm middle-aged but have felt this way for decades.Agreed. I've been whining about this to my family for a couple years. You should be tested every couple of years after say 70. Though, it could be a financial burden for low income seniors. Maybe make auto credits or something with taxes. People forget that most drivers over 65 have never taken a driver's test period. They used to just be able to apply at the post office.This is where self-driving cars will make a real difference in people's lives - allowing seniors to retain some independence without endangering the public or themselves. I'm not looking forward to the day I can no longer just hop in a car and go wherever I want whenever I want but I also know the reality is that visual acuity and reflexes start declining after a certain point and at some point, driving will become too much of a risk. Fortunately for me, that point should still be a long ways ahead and by that time, self-driving cars should be ready for prime time. I wish that technology has been available for my grandmother who was still a mentally and socially active person but could no longer safely drive herself around anymore and had to depend on family to get her around or the limited senior shuttles provided by the community. Oh, what a surprise. Redditors (average age: 20.7) wholeheartedly supporting a stupid law that wouldn't affect them. Different day, same story...For those in the US: this is for British law, I visited the link and it said "you are already signed up and we will send you email updates." No clue...,This needs to happen for young adults as well. Too many people don't obey the rules of the road and have no idea what to do if an emergency vehicle is coming up behind them.You can forget a lot about driving since you received your licence. Being old is a big part of the cause but there's a lot of people that can't drive for shit and they're no where near that age.

My personal opinion, every 5 years WITH an accident should qualify you for a retest.
If you go 5 years with solid driving keep on keeping on.How about refresher courses every 10 years for every driver, because fuck me there are some terrible drivers out there of every age As much as I would support this, I doubt it would pass as politcians would likely be too afraid to anger the age group with the largest voter turnouts.I've been thinking about this for a while, I think in order for it to not be political suicide it can't look like it's targeting old people. So I suggest retesting for everyone.

It'd work like this, assuming you're in a jurisdiction where the licensing age is 16 you obviously get tested then, and again at 18. I think the problem with our US System is you're thrown at the test before you have any real experience so in order for anyone to be licensed the standards are comically low. So still give that 16 year their own (possibly provisional) licence, but make them come back two years later and show they can do more than drive around the parking lot and parallel park.

After that, restest *everyone* every five years (so 23, 28, 33, 33, etc). Even if you passed at 18 with flying colors, bad habits still sneak in and there's a lot of "mature" drivers who seem to forget how priority is assigned at a four way stop sign, or how to safely merge. Retesting ensures those rules stay fresh, making the roads safer for everyone.

At 63 begin retesting every other year. Everyone accepts the fact that our bodies eventually aren't as good as they used to be, but we all also think it hasn't effected us too badly. So prove it, retest and prove you still got it.

Failing a test you should have two choices, go without for three months until you can retest or go through an education course and retest immediately after passing the course. It'll suck, failing a test will have serious implications for people's lives and careers. But it won't suck nearly as much as dying in a car crash because someone doesn't know how to check their fucking blindspots. I hope we have self-driving cars before we all get old.Refresher courses/tests should be mandatory every 5 years or so, regardless of age, imo. 

After the age of 70 or so, make it yearly. My only concern is the age cutoff. Is there evidence that a significant spike in traffic accidents occurs at the age of 70? Or is it 73? 75? Pick the age that makes sense statistically. 

This should happen every 10 years after your initial test.  Then at like 50 or 60 y/o it should be every 5 years or something like that.  My sister is 40 and she scares the shit out of me because of how clueless she is.  The tests are way too easy to begin with imo. I would say 50, then repeat at 60, then every 5 years.Can we just have a real drivers test too. And a retest every 5 years or so? There are some shitty fucking drivers out there.. Relatively little bad driving is rooted in knowledge deficiencies. 

A little help might be better than nothing, but attitudes, intentions, conscientiousness, and physical capabilities strike me as far more important. And you can't realistically fix any of those.Honestly I think everyone should be required to retest every 5 or 10 years then take a more extensive test at 70.  The 70+ age group is probably one of the worst but you see a lot of bad driving across all age ranges.Everyone should have to go through a course every 5-10 years depending on their records. The more tickets a person has, the more frequent they are mandated to go through a driver's ed course and is ineligible to renew until they prove they went through the course.Good on you Brits, I wish someone would do the same in USLovely but I'm fairly sure that younger drivers are far, far worse. How about a petition to remove the trillion speed bumps and 20 mph signs painted in the roads ALL over London ? Ffs!IMO we should be retesting all drivers every five years.  Vision and reaction time can decrease to anyone regardless of age.Why does it say I have already supported this petition? I most certainly have not... This is my first time seeing it.How about 80% of drivers?

I drive for a living, and you're all fucking terrible drivers.

Yes, *even you*. *Especially you*.I don't think a course will really do anything. Older drivers that are problematic don't forget the rules so much as they lack the reaction time and ability to appropriately divide attention to drive. It would be much better just to put them in driving simulators and see if they are safe every five years. I think it's also a lot less demeaning than asking cognitively intact 70 year olds to sit through a course about the importance of staying on the right (ok well this is uk so left I guess?) except to pass.I think every 10 years you should have to get some kinda refresher course. Or have people take advanced driving courses.That's not intense enough. You should have to retake a test every ten years until you are 60. Every 2 years after that.The link just auto-signs you up for the petition. I signed it and I'm not even sure what I signed because it auto-did it when I clicked the link. Not cool. At least every other day I have this thought when taking care of elderly patients in the hospital. "Sir is someone gonna drive you home" " no I can drive myself".......as his blood pressure is temporarily controlled but often remains insanely high near potential stroke levels because he doesn't feel like taking his medication, heart arrhythmia controlled for now, lower back pain from degenerative diseases, on their third eye surgery, barely able to turn his neck, with two hearing aids.

Yeah, clearly safe to drive /s 
Why single out old people? There are tons of terrible drivers on the road of all ages. I honestly think everyone needs a refresher course every so often. Like, every 4-5 years everyone should have to re-test. And we need to be stricter about what is passing and not passing. And we need automated cars for those who can't pass.[deleted]In Illinois, medical personnel and law enforcement can ask the courts to conduct an "unsafe driver investigation" when someone is 75 or older and they believe the person to be significantly impaired, physically or mentally.


 It can be very hard for families to handle this on their own with no real "power" or say over an adult. Just a small thought on this, I'm not arguing against the idea, i know my grandmother lost her driving privileges after she hit two parked cars (thankfully).

Once you look at the elderly and start restricting them, then people will start looking at raising the driving age, because the newest drivers are in a higher bracket of accidents as well <- mainly due to lack of experience which just boils down to a catch-22.  

I would actually like a system that is a more rigorous test and defensive driving classes.  Or just get the public transit system built up properly.Fuck 70. Make it 55 or 60.On the verge of driverless cars, and now we're doing this? A little late guys.You should post this in every other automotive subredditMy granddad is one of the best drivers I know and have complete trust in his ability and he's getting up there in age. I also know other older drivers that shouldn't be allowed to drive what so ever.

Thet also need to make that a yearly course for all drivers in America. Middle aged people are honestly scarier than most of the teens I go to school with just because after they do it for so long you get too relaxed and think things only apply to new drivers (turn signal, looking both ways at a stop sign, etc.) 

And while we're at it can we have a mandatory basic car maintenance course? You don't have to be a pro mechanic but everyone should be able to check their fluids and know when it's time to take it in for servicing before it becomes a hazzard for everyone else on the road (breaks go out, loose lug nuts, oil levels, power steering fluid, transmission fluid) Not only making things safer but better for traffic to. It's surprising that this wasn't done soonerFuck, we need this in the States. I was driving behind some ancient lady going 30 in a 45 towards a light that turned red. Instead of slowing down to stop she just sailed through the light in slow motion. It's crazy how often that kind of thing happens with that age groupMy sister was stopped to take a left and got nailed from behind after 25 seconds by a 91 year old driver. Car totaled, lucky she wore a seatbelt.umm, how about 60. 

Fuck, I actually think a drivers license is something that everyone should have to re-test for every 10-15 years. Doesnt seem to crazy to me.In Canada once you turn 80 you need to re-take the driving test every year And here in Denmark where we have this, seniors are petitioning to reverse it. They say it's discrimination, I say it's common sense. Is there a lack of concerned family members in the U.K. or something?  How can we do something like this in America?Personally I think everyone should have to take a refresher on every 10th year cause damn near everyone lacks driving skills as far as I've seen itI personally think everyone should do a refresher course and test every 10 years after one first gets their license. Near where I live 2 women were killed recently, ran over on a CAR PARK by an elderly person It should be a refresher course every decade. If the DMV was seriously revised, I'd say do a refresher course every 10 years. There's way too many shitty drivers on the roadInteresting to see how many lives this savesBecause, as schoolhouse rock taught us, the first step towards passing a law is making a reddit post about it.Old people are such a pain in the ass to teachYa we have that in Canada, after 75 or 80 you take the drivers test every year.This needs to happen in the US.Literally just yesterday, I got run off the road into a ditch by what appeared to be a 80-90 year old driver. She turned directly into us from a stop sign (we didn't have one) and we saw her coming about a second early and laid on the horn. She didn't look back and kept going, so we had to swerve into a ditch at the last possible second. Car took a hard jolt leaving the road and we were unsure as to whether or not she had hit us. She never looked back and appeared to have no idea what happened despite constant horn. Unsure as to whether or not an accident had actually happened, we got back on the road, caught up - she was going about 15 in a 35 - and laid on the horn to get her to pull over and she never once looked back. I presume she was deaf. Called the cops when she wouldn't stop (and oddly, started looping back in the exact same direction she had come from), gave her plate numbers, and they came and took a report but told us there's literally nothing they would do about this. Also, if we swerved to avoid her reckless failure to yield and hit a tree, we would be liable, not her. Wonderful. About to buy a dash cam...This should be implemented with middle aged suburban housewives as well.The other day me and my girlfriend were in her car at a gas station. An old man backed into her front bumper with his silver impala. He just drove away. He didn't leave a dent in her car, only his, so I didn't bother to pursue even though I had the plate.It's a nice idea, but the elderly react to anything that appears to them to be an attempt to take their driving privileges with the same kind of rage and indignation that about half the people in the US have when the topic of gun control comes up.I have to recertify myself every year to show the powers that be, that I still know how a computer works.

Considering that motor vehicle deaths are so high, and the constant complaints from literally fucking everywhere that people drive like idiots, and traffic is terrible, driving refresher courses should be mandatory way more often than once, at a fairly high age that makes no difference. Every 4/8 years, when you renew your license, you should be doing refresher courses. 

Do street signs, defensive driving, inclement weather training, traffic causes, road design theory, whatever else they can come up with to educate people about different driving topics. Can we get something like this in the usa?  Make it safe for everyone and create jobs...... maybeHonestly, I think retaking the written and driver test should be required every 10 years (or let's just say every third renewal license, which is every 12 years for most, if not all states).  No need to single out elderly.  There are a LOT of bad drivers out there, and the reality is most of them are far from elderly.As a Geriatric Social Worker, I can tell you that it is not a lack of knowledge in regard to the rules or the road, but rather a loss of reflexes, reaction time, etc.  A refresher course will not restore lost function in these domains.  I do, however, think re-testing is in order, with forfeiture of licensure as a consequence of test failure.I'd rather it be every 10 years for everyone, maybe not as extensive as this. I get that there are a ton of stories about how old people shouldn't drive.

What I find interesting is that looking back on all of the people I've flipped off driving over the years none of them were older than 50. Food for thought.If this is a petition being circulated by senior citizens, then funny enough I could support it. If its from some kid 18-20 who just got his license then I consider it a douche bag post, by a douche bag kid.

As far as life experience goes every fatal accident that has ever made news in my personal life, was someone between the age of 18-26, with slippery roads, refusal to slow down, and inexperience being the factors in nearly every occurrence.

Also at the age of 67, driving truck for nearly 40 years my old man has been in one accident. A guy ran a red light and T boned his rig, the guy was lucky to survive, he was 25 years old.

When you consider who is in a larger rush in life, senior citizens or the newly crowned drivers, and how much speed factors into accidents, it leaves this petition looking lob sided in its limited view.Why just 70, though? I think everyone should have to pass a road test every five years, in their own car, with an instructor ride-along. And not just a bullshit "go spin around the block" test. If they fall to signal a lane change? Fail. If they futz with the radio while driving? Fail. If they don't turn the lights on while the wipers are on? Fail. You can take it a maximum of once a month, and if you fail, your license is revoked until you pass. 

I'm tired of having to dodge morons on my commute.I think everyone needs a refresher course every 5 years tbhHoly shit this is exactly what I said needs to happen. 3 times this week I've almost been in an accident because an elderly person couldn't be bothered to shoulder check or look both ways before making a left turn. To be completely honest, I feel like everyone should have to pass a driving test every time they renew their license. I think there should be a refresher course every x years.  Make insurance companies pay for it or something.I would actually like to see that people have to take a "What's new" type refresher courses at least every 10 years. Where I live there's been a lot of roundabouts added in the last 10 years, and you can clearly see people, who weren't thought the proper way to drive through them, that do it each in their own way. Some indicate that they'r going to stay in the round about, some don't indicate, some use the multilane roundabouts as a single lane, etc. We now even have an [outwards spiral roundabout](https://www.google.com/maps/@46.0808561,14.5276454,277m/data=!3m1!1e3?hl=en) with lights that is confusing for everyone the first few times.

Oh, and those safety driving courses on wet terrain and slippery surfaces would also be a good idea every 10 years, so people learn a bit more about handling of cars, so they don't do stupid things when in unexpected situations.60.I'm totally up for *all around* higher degree of difficulty in operating a vehicle in public.  It's WAAAAAAY too easy to get a driver's license IMO.  I see people joke about how bad they are, or how they can't figure out how to back up, or rely on the absolute maximum braking power with each stop.
It's not cute or funny when you are operating a vehicle near me or my family.  Make it harder.  Oh wait...that'll cut down on your revenue.  This systems sucks.

Edit:  why isn't a driver's license similar to obtaining building permits?  Sure, the municipality would make more money if they just approved everything with little to no review, but somehow it's been engrained in our culture that building safety is much more desirable than immediate tax revenue. I wish would could apply some of that logic to driving.  "In our state, it's ridiculously hard to get a license.  We have 93% fewer vehicle-related deaths per year than the next closest state"

Something like that anyway.A lot of people say this is ageism and whatnot and because of that, these measures(in the US at least) typically fail. That's why I think a refresher test should happen every 16 years. 16, 32, 48, 64, etc. This will make it more like a normal thing everybody has to do, instead of something that only affects a specific demo.probably should do it every 10 years, at least so its equally annoying to everyone. Can we have a refresher course every 10 years instead for all drivers? that would be swell.Can we get this in Canada also please. I absolutely love and respect our elderly so I want what is best for them. By reassessing their abilities we can remove the poor drivers and empower those that remain while making our roads much safer. 

Additionally, I am all for routine retesting of drivers who fail to meet the criteria set forth by a reasonable transportation department. Wait a second, why does this thing say it's already registered my signature?  I've never signed it, nor would I since I live in Florida not the UK.  If it was Florida I would sign it.I live in Arizona, and my drivers license doesn't expire until I turn 65. I need to get new pictures every once in a while, but still. this makes me think of how a private pilot license works (I'm licensed, but have not flown in over 5 years so correct me if I'm wrong).

For a private pilot license in the U.S. you pass the test and get the license. It does not expire, but if you screw up pretty bad it could get revoked.

However - they have something called a "Biennial Review" (which they keep changing the title of because they don't want it to sound like a test...). Anyway - every two years you are required to meet up with an instructor pilot. He does a bit of ground training with you, answers any questions you have... then, you go fly together for an hour or so. Technically, if he is not happy with your skillset then he isn't going to sign off your books and you can't fly past the two year mark until you get him (or another instructor) to sign it off. So, you are in a sense... grounded. They really try to PUSH that it is not a TEST and that it is an OPPORTUNITY for you to get a bit of training and make sure you aren't doing something unsafe.

In addition, the FAA will allow online training, certain pilot events (a safety presentation, etc) to count as time toward the "ground training" portion of your biennial commitment.

I think this is a pretty good system because it allows all pilots to touch base with a skilled individual every two years and review how they are doing things to make sure they are safe. It also prevents people from letting their skillset decline to the point they are a hazard to others.Just FYI, for US drivers: a patient's doctor can revoke their license based on medical necessity (Dementia/Alzheimer's is a *very* common reason for this). It can be hard on the patient, and doesn't remove the need to physically take a car away in some cases, but you don't need the DMV to administer a test for this. In NYS, this is the DS-6 form."Texting and driving is the equivalent of a 74 year old driver."


THEN WHY IS NOBODY TALKING ABOUT 74 YEAR OLD DRIVERS?


Yeah, that's when commercials stopped using that line.Hell, every 10 years I say!How about making the test harder?

I know a terrible 85 year old driver. He can pass the test no problem.I was told by my insurance agent that my 72 year old mother would need a doctor's permission slip for driving to acquire insurance for her to drive a car (you cannot re-new your license without insurance). So while the "law" maybe lacking in this area the insurance companies have your back.I'm so glad I'm not the only one. My restaurant serves mostly older people who live in the surrounding neighborhood, their whole life they never wanted to drive more than 5 mins from home. Regularly we have people park on curbs, get out see they parked shitty, then just leave it. We had a guy drive over a median and pop all 4 tires and had to get a tow truck to pull his car off the grassy curb. I've seen waiters park cars for people who try 30 times before giving up. And when it comes to Alzheimer's we had a regular who would come in every day, thinking it was 20 years ago and always ask where his friends were, ask you to read his watch for him, and then just get in his car and drive away. People would always stare at me like I was crazy when I would comment how terrifying it was that he was driving everyday. Yeah I can empathize with his condition, but that man could easily have killed someone...

This needs to happen in the US like yesterday
Everyone everywhere with a license should be retested every three to five years. People forget and neglect shit when they become complacent and I can guarantee that people who have been driving for forty years are complacent. People that drive and constantly get into small accidents are complacent. Retesting and retraining people would iron out this complacency. I'd sign that.  I was at the DMV and saw an old 90 something year old lady that was mostly deaf and completely blind in one eye pass the test.  Everyone waiting was looking around at each other like are you effing kidding me?! Very few people would pass a driving test in Ireland and UK over 70.

So are you gonna fund someone to take them to the grocery or doctor? Or fund them having to into a nursing home when they can no longer drive. Everything is linked and stopping old people from driving is gonna result in a lot of collateral costs.Just in time for self driving cars. We have a 94 year old woman who drives in our town. She is really small and can barely see over the steering wheel. Its quite scary to see her drive as she goes around cutting corners and ending up on the wrong side of the road.

I definitely think there should be a re-test for people atleast 70-80I see that south park episode has finally come to life.

"I believe in respect for old people, grandpa, I just don't wanna die."Just have kids that are starting to drive take them to the places they need. They will quickly realize they would rather just stay home.Yesterday I went to Trader Joe's (a grocery store) and right at the exit there was this little old lady parked in front of the exit. Like right in front of it... on the sidewalk. As she was leaving she drive her car into the shelves of flowers and just kept going until she almost hit a person. People then somewhat blocked her from going further forward but instead of backing up like everyone was yelling at her, she slowly crept even further forward...

Not my problem and I have other things to do, but I could help but shake my head and laugh. I mean, if there's no better example of why retesting is important than with this senile old lady. Probably should start at 65Fuck a refresher course. That is as insulting as it is useless. How about a basic competency test? From outside the vehicle so the stupid shit people lose marks for (actual drivers driver habits) don't infuriate people needlessly. Like 'omg you only have one hand on the wehll, minus two points. And you're doing it again, two more points'.We need something like this in the US too, but I think this ought to start at 65.As an employee of an Ophthalmology office this should definitely be a thing. We have pts, all usually over the age of 70 that tell us upon examination their vision is great. Then they proceed to read 20/60 or worse. Have to be 20/40 or better in each individual eye to legally drive (unless there is a medical reason you can't be). It's a lot worse than people realize. And these old folks don't care. At all. Maybe I'm a jerk, but I do what I can to get them to stop driving. Tell them they aren't legal to drive. Tell them that if they have an accident with this vision they are liable. I'll do whatever it takes to get some of these people off the road!Hells fuckin yes. Living and working as a hospitalist in a place where there is a significant senior population I see people that I'm completely flabbergasted are capable of driving. Patients can't manage to find their room in an area where there's only 3 rooms. A gentleman last week was driving despite his families protests, when his vision was checked it was found that he was legally blind. Super scary stuff YES IVE SAYING THIS FOR YEARS!That there are not laws like this belies the terrible nature of elder care in the united states.

Or: the reason why these laws don't come up is partly due to the fact that this would strand the elderly in areas where they can't care for themselves.Won't matter in 20 years... a "course" isn't going to help elders with memory disordersWe just need to take humans away from the controls all together.This may be a good idea for cities with well established, all-encompassing public transportation system. It it isn't feasible for most of the U.S., however, because most of the U.S. is heavily car-dependent, and elderly people are forced to drive because they can't get to the store for food and medication or to the doctor for an exam.I like this... Can we add a part where every Memphis resident has to do this once a year?This is something I've been clamoring for the U.S. to do as well, maybe even at a younger age. I wish we would.I'd support this but truthfully, we'll probably have self-driving cars before this passes.Eyesight and cognition fades in some people much sooner than 70. I strongly believe that starting at age 50, a person should be able to pass a quick eye test and pass a quick driving course in a simulator/their own vehicle. The simulator or road course should focus on reaction time and attention to traffic. After 50, your license should expire every two years and you should be required to repeat the tests to continue to drive.U.S. take note please and thank you**70?!** People should have to take a new driving test every 10 years at a max. From driving age through 30, and post-70, it should be every 3 years. Petition to implement a refresher course for drivers every 5 years, and after it snows. 

- Concerned CalgarianCan we please make this 30+? I swear to god I see too many oblivious young adults driving these days... I always said have a refresher after 30, 50, and 70...if you're driving at 90, fuck it! Do what you wantHow has no one mentioned the obvious hole in this idea? What 70 year old do you know would give two shits about this law?  They just will fall into suspension and keep driving anyway, then you'll have a bunch of cops pulling seniors over for easy tickets and then you'll have a bunch of angry 50 year olds. Honestly there needs to be a course for whenever you renew your license, the worst drivers I see are 30-40 somethings who don't signal, don't understand the rules of the road, and are often driving distracted. 

bump that down to 60 and you've got yourself a fresh signature. Honestly, all of that should come as stipulations for stuff like Medicare and the AARP. But, whoe is me, I'm but a normal person without. I remember a store next door to a place a used to work at got their front wall bashed in, right by the parking lot. Apparently it was an ~85 year old lady trying to get out of the parking lot or something.Meh I'd rather have a petition to get them free ubers or automated cars.Why discriminate?  Let's have mandatory retesting every 5 years between getting your license and age 60 then every 2 years.   It'll improve everyone on the road.  Who's against it?  Old farts that vote.  Insurance companies will pay lip-service to it, but their revenues will drop, so they'll remain ambivalent.. claiming a hands-off attitude.  What this isn't already a thing? As an Australian after 75yrs you have mandatory driving tests, and medicals,  my great uncle lost his licence due to this and ended up with a "modified" licence, which kind of restricts how far they are allowed to drive, so they can go to the local shops but driving an hour on the freeway to some other town is a nono.. citation http://m.nrmasaferdriving.com.au/senior-lessons.htmIn Slovakia, elderlypeople over 60 have to retake course, and then after 70 they do the driving test every 2 years.Muscle memory can pass those tests easily....its when you don't remember which pedal does what is when you can no longer get behind the wheel...Younger drivers are MUCH more of a concern. Don't be fooled by anecdotal evidence and South Park episodes. Has anybody else driven at a shopping center during weekdays before everyone at school and work get home? It's like the apocalypseWhy not just restrict old people to cars made of balsa wood and rice paper?I don't think the elderly need a "refresher course".  They should just need to pass a test after a certain age.   Just to make sure they're competent to drive. Petitions never work that shit worthless than dirt. I support this petition because of examples such as this:

http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/live-withington-hospital-car-crash-12705058
Just this weekend I watched what had to be an 80 year old man parallel park his E-class. There wasnt even close to being enough room, but he made room. He backed into the car behind him and just kept backing up until his car fit in the space.If I make it to 70 and this is federal law, I'm just going to say fuck that and drive anyway.The best source of data analysis (in the US) on this comes from insurance company actuaries.

Why not take a look at [two simple graphs?](https://imgur.com/a/KJDXJ)70? How about an actual test to give people licenses in the first place and then a test every 10 years after that. People wouldn't feel the need for self-driving cars if the roads actually had intelligent, rational people on themDrop that to 65 and I'm on board. The written test should also include a brief attention span and reaction time test. Maybe situational awareness too.70? Try fucking 50, the amount of older drivers in my area who are clueless to the modern rules is absurd. I'm at the point I'm terrified of using roundabouts because they don't understand them and just go, or stop inside to let people in causing everyone behind them to slam of their brakes. 50+ years without retests is fucking retarded. Less retarded than how it is currently, but only slightly.Lets start this in Florida!!!Make it 55Why just people over 70? The last time I saw someone use a turn signal, GW Bush was president.  Seems like lots of people need a refresher.I would go one step further and say mandatory basic retest every 5 years to retain your license.EVERY DRIVER needs to have their skills tested every 4 years.Great, now this needs to be a thing in the states. Countless times have I been behind or around people 70+ who are terrible drivers or are completely oblivious to those around them. Heck, one even backed straight into me the other day because they weren't looking in their mirrors or anything.  They just reversed and hoped for the best. I always do a refresher course before I SCUBAUnpopular opinion, but I think EVERYONE should take a refresher course every 10 years a common sense re-test every 5 (or so) years would not go amiss.I wrote and made a speech promoting this exact thing, 15 years ago in college in a "Speech 101" class... and was called an ageist, even though my points were well laid out with facts and statistics.  It's a slippery slope, to say that least.Fuck it should literally be every 10 years. I can't handle my rage at the amount of suck on the roads from so many other drivers.Pilots need a bi-annual flight review every two years in the US, I'm sure the UK has something similar as well. I don't understand why we all don't have to take an annual exam every couple of years or so, seems like the prudent thing to do when you are in charge of a couple-thousand pound vehicle. I bet the car companies would hate that. Please do this in Canada too. I'm pretty sure we have that, but I think we need more. 

Just yesterday I saw a guy who could barely stand up, and could barely count his change when paying the cashier get in a car, nearly smack into the car behind him and then he drove off. Slowly... super slowly... 

If you need to drive 30km in a 60km area for safety reasons such as poor reaction time and eye sight, you probably shouldn't be driving. 

I know.. I know "some day you'll be in his place" but it's easy for me to say this because my car will drive for me when i'm 90 mwahahahaCan we call it "self driving cars 101?"What is the real need behind this refresher?

Yes, I know people may get Alzheimer but when a person with this condition forgets how to eat, I doubt that they will drive.

So the question is what is the problem so we know what we are looking after.I'm not sure about this. The end goal of the course would be to identify issues and have the drivers correct them. What percentage of 70 year olds are willing to change behaviours that have previously worked for them?[removed]Maybe I'm in the minority here, but I think refresher courses every 5 years would be a complete clusterfuck.  What I would recommend is:

1: More stringent training/testing to begin with.  We need to make sure people know how to drive before they are put in the position of being able to kill other people.  Two year learners permit, a stringent driving test, we should be good.

2: The ability for doctors/psychologists to recommend retesting when they believe a person's driving ability to be in danger, and a fine imposed on whoever the hell signed off on Grandpa who can barely navigate his wheelchair continuing to drive.  Age isn't the only thing that changes a person's ability to drive, brain injuries and psychological issues are two of probably many things that can contribute.

3: A refresher course at certain periods, maybe at 60 years old and every 5 years after.

4: If someone is convicted of driving drunk or on drugs, they should never get their license back.  Sorry, it's just the way it should be.

Seriously, people drive every day, so it's the most practiced skill most people have.  There's no reason people between the ages of 18 and late fifties should have to retest constantly, and frankly, that's a recipe for disaster with most DMV's.  Driving tests are not going to fix morons/assholes, and that's where the issue are.  Make it hard to get a license in the first place, so a person really knows how to drive before they can drive, and make punishments for reckless driving harsher.  

It should also be pointed out that before any good legislation can be instituted and ironed out, and definitely before American DMV's would be able to get their shit together (I know, this isn't for the US) HOPEFULLY we will have self-driving cars that make driving safer for everyone.50. Over the age of 50. Cause usually around that age people stop giving a fuck.70? Let's make it 60. I live in Florida. 60 is when they START ignoring speed limit signs and traffic lights, by 70 it's too late. I think every driver should have to re-test at 60, and then every subsequent 5 years after that. Just to be safe. How much inconvenience is it to retake the test?I think there should be a refresher every 5 years at least.Honestly - to prevent arguments of agism, and because there are plenty of fucking god awful drivers who aren't old people why not just have people go through full retests whenever they renew their license?

I mean I think getting bad drivers off the road is a good thing - I am terrified to get in the car with my aunt but she is only 55 and nothing anyone says or does will stop her from driving.  She will likely kill some one one day though.How about all drivers every 5 years or so?There are extremely shitty drivers of all ages.Call it "grandfathered in"70? Should've be at 60, and every 5 years thereafter Link doesn't work. Can we get one of these in the USA too? Or just make it like a "federation" law?[removed][removed][removed]I tend to agree that a license should be skill based.  Hurdling down the road with a two ton weight at 70 mph is a big responsibility.  Maybe if you can't handle it, you shouldn't have access to a license.it says ive already supported this petition, obviously thats a mistake. how do i undo it?[removed]57 fucking signatures?Hell yeah, that’s awesome!Wow, so this is a Georgia state road?

Your previous post about it being a convenient shortcut between two state highways combined with photos of the narrow lanes and adverse gradients made me assume it was a county road that had become over-trafficked.Right on. Not only helps you but might save some lives in the processThat's awesome, especially after going back and checking out the pics..deceptive that curveSome of my former Ga Tech classmates went on to work for Ga DOT. Good folks and excellent engineers.  Congrats on what looks like a path forward.That’s a much better resolution than the suggestions I saw to prevent people from having fatal accidents in your yard by building a rock wall that they would hit before dying outside the perimeter.[deleted]Great to hear that the issue will be fixed! It's always weird to see how reddit helps people but it's amazing when done it does happen.Right on. Always refreshing to hear good news. Your Reddit thread may have inadvertently saved lives, and that's pretty cool.Certainly not every day you catch the attention of the very person you need to help solve a problem on the interwebs, and certainly not very often that it's a government official.

Good to know things are moving for you!Looked at original thread. That looks like a bad corner, obviously. Good on you and Mr. Engineer for trying to fix the issue.What the what! Wholesome reddit cars? Amazed.  

Though, I guess you are, after all...an Emperor?That's awesome that happened, and in my home state as well!That's awesome. I also work for a stage DOT as an engineer, this will be a fun read.That’s awesome, honestly one of those feel good stories. Thank you kind sir for helping this man outThat’s a fantastic outcome. Mr. Engineer is a Marvelous human being. Can’t wait to see the outcome.Off-topic but your house looks amazing. But I also see it’s Georgia so that mansion of yours probably costs less than a 1 bedroom condo in Cali.Very coolGot to shout out for the GA DOT engineers... always top class people and great solutions....


Senior management TDBNot really on topic, but I’m a car crash investigator and I’ve actually gotten crash scene photographs (usually accompanied by descriptions like “holy shit a car just hit my house”) from social media. Telling people shit happened is actually useful sometimes!It's totally worth it to reach out to a DOT engineer especially if you are having persistent issues. I had to deal with an intersection during major construction that would not turn green for 10 minutes if there wasn't 4 or more cars there and was a pain during off hours.

I called up my states DOT and eventually worked though a calling tree and left a message stating the intersection, time of day I was there, what the light wasn't doing, was doing etc.

Two days later I get a phone call back from the engineer that they looked up the intersection in question at that time, found that it wasn't turning for cars and tuned it so that it would turn green periodically, even without detecting many cars. And from then on it was never a problem.I dont wanna burst your bubble but its not gonna be done in a few months. they just started to look at the problem. 
They have to go get the budget for the project. Then hire an engineering firm. Then they'll have to buy some land from your neighbors and you to get the space they need to the new road. They have to make a survey of the place. Then design it.
 Once approved they can finaly go and hire a constructor that will make his own preparation to the project. And only then the work can begin. 
Also since summer is starting soon i dont believe all the design and all can be completed before winter so its gonna be minimum in 1 year. If not 2. And be prepared to gain or loose some of your driveway as the road is not gonna be at the same place prbly. A road that is that dangerous prbly doesnt have the right radius for the speed and its not necessarily the width of the bank etc...That is amazing. I love this site sometimes. Cheers to the anonymous redditor!If you are out there, Mr. Engineer, I thank you. I live on the opposite corner of the country, but I still thank you for making the world a bit safer.This should be headline newsSomething so small making a big impact. Your post likely will save people medical bills and possible death.I grew up with the same issue in Georgia as well. My parents house is in the north Atlanta area and there's a really sharp turn going into a downhill that people speed like crazy around. I can't even count how many mailboxes we've lost from people losing control, busting through the brick mailboxes at the top of our driveway, and then crashing into a tree on our property lol. So many memories over 10+ years of waking up in the middle of the night to an accident lmao. I'm still surprised that nobody had any major injuries, though it did leave me with a lot of paranoia waiting for the school bus every day...I coincidentally just watched a video about why cars crash into buildings more often in the US. Don’t know if it’s of interest or not, but here it is https://youtu.be/Ra_0DgnJ1uQThe second week of living in my present home, someone ran off the road and took out my mailbox.

The previous owner had grown tired of people taking out his box, so he sunk two steel i-beams into a 4’x2’x 1’ deep concrete block an mounted his and the neighbor’s mailbox onto it. 

The car tire marks indicate that the car touched down about 25’ away from the initial mailbox launch point. It then hit an electric pole head on then spun 90 degrees before coming to stop. 

I estimate they were going at least 60-65 on a 35 mph road and what should have been a 25mph curve. Everyone lived, though!As much as I hate Reddit, man do I love reddit. That's awesome.

I looked at the original pictures and I don't really get it. So you live on a straight part, and people are coming out of a curve at the end of your street and crashing into your yard because they can't see the road straightens out?Lmao that george peach accentYea, you can pretty obviously tell in the second picture that the road is banked the wrong way.Fantastic!Glad to see how this turned out!It always makes me smile when people help other people out, and things are set right. Thanks for sharing.This reminds me of [this Practical Engineering video](https://youtu.be/9XIjqdk69O4). Essentially roads need to be curved correctly so drivers can always see the road up ahead. There are so many considerations to take into account.Crack a fat that's a mad outcome :) Nice one mate!Cobb county resident here. Never clicked on the OP but damn that’s a nice house!Very cool! Props to the unidentified engineer! You are awesome!Very good outcome but can they not use road accident data to find these dangerous spots? Surely they should already be aware that this corner was an issue.Now as tenacious d says. “ that’s fucking teamwork!”Thanks for the update!  Read both posts and glad the engineer took it upon himself to make it happen.That's a shitty road for sure, definitely not engineered. 

I ride and do a lot of back roads spirited riding. The reason you can go fast is because roads are engineered to make sense; basically, you can assume a road will curve at a constant rate and the curve will be something you've seen before. After so many miles no curve will really surprise you. 

It's the low traffic, super sparse back roads with no engineering that get you. Once you learn them they're awesome cause you have chicanes and shit like this but new riders fuck up all the time. 

Also, you can't visually follow a tree line to help here, making it extra difficult. 

Case in point - don't speed. But if you do, only do it after you've scouted the road. Otherwise you're just hoping it's engineered well and there's nothing on the road or any of the other 15 things that could fuck you up.I swear this same thing happened to me.  I complained on /r/toronto about how you have 50m to merge into 120kph traffic on the 401, then another 500m to move over 4 lanes.  It had been like that for decades, but 1 week after I complained on Reddit, they fixed it, lengthened the merging lane.The things we car car peeps will geek out about. This is awesome! I can’t wait to see the changes and engineering info!Are you a British guy who moved to the South at age 10Unrelated but I think you have the absolute most perfect southern accent I’ve ever heard.i remember your thread! this in an awe-inspiring response! mad props to that other redditor traffic engineer.So if they bank the turn that means we can take it faster......So badass, props to anonymous! So cool to see a problem fixed due to our favorite circle jerk subreddit.I lost my dad to a motorcycle accident in Gerogia on a curve similar the one you described in your original post. A sincere and heartfelt thanks to both of you for making the roads a safer place.You have a lovely speaking voice. The accent and the chilliness is great.I always wonder how much any given intersection or road is "monitored" by the various DOTs versus just waiting for accident reports to create that feedback loop.  
  
Cool to see this one getting worked on.Yoo, your house is fucking beautiful, my man, I'm quite envious. As for the road, it's awesome to see that everything is going smoothly now, hopefully there are no hang ups and your problem is fixed in no time.

&#x200B;

Now, I'm gonna go look for that vault thread, an underground gun locker seems like just the keep of unachievable fantasy for me.heh, thats pretty freakin awesome.Thank you to our kind engineering stranger!  Keeping people safe and renewing my faith in Reddit once more.are you originally from virginia op?Hahaha, you're born and raised in Georgia aren't you? I'm an Ohioan but I know that accent anywhere, we drove through Georgia just about every year on the way to Florida when my Grandparents were still alive. Georgia has got to be the center of Southern hospitality. I think it was Georgia we always stopped for gas at the border cuz Georgia has (or had) a low gas tax.NiceeeeI'm such an asshole I'd just set up a nice chair on my porch overlooking the curve, crack open a cold one and just enjoy the show.

But I guess it gets old quick.Remind me! 1 monthOP please update this post with the follow thru so my reminders help!
This is one of the coolest internet stories. Well a really cool oneThat’s really coolu/RemindMeBot 2 monthsHe'll fucking yeah my dude. GDOT are goddamn heros. This state is a fucking disaster case when it comes to driving and I'm sure they are all overworked and underpaid. Hope you stop getting lawn ornaments. Can't wait for the next thread.!remindme 1 yearBrilliant!Wouldn't the DOT be keeping crash stats from all over and have this on their radar? Or is this a case of it being on their radar and simply the engineer pushing up the priority?That's amazing. Does he/do you think if I contacted my local DoT/ power company they could move a very unfortunately placed power pole?  If you don't take the turn in front of my parents house you slam into the pole. At least one high school couple has died in their yard from failing the curve.That's great news.  I responded to your last thread suggesting you pester the government more, a traffic engineer responded with some good information on the types of changes they may be able to implement.  Maybe it was him, hope you finally have some peace on your property.This is why I fucking love RedditAnon redditor comes through in the clutch. So awesome.That's so awesome. Things like this are why I love the internetThis is great! Happy for you, man! Keep us all informed.thats awesome man and what a beautiful home !Amazing, Ill be looking forward to see the progress.this is just awesomeI’m getting chills thinking about this. Did something positive come from Reddit.  Good work anonymous inspector dude.!remindme 4 monthsDamn. I get frequent car crashes in my front yard as well. Almost killed our whole family once, ran right into our gas main. All the signage and even some banking mean nothing. Once a month someone ends up in the dirt. Could use a nice engineer friend.In Seoul, South Korea there is a city app where you upload pics of problems with a geo tag and it will be reviewed and fixed if needed. I think this is a excellent idea.Congrats on finding a solution.

My church in NC has a similar issue.  Long straightaway followed by a tight left corner.  If you miss the turn, you end up hitting a 200+ year old stone wall surrounding the cemetery.

Those stones have been re-stacked more times than we can count but the state won’t do anything to correct the road.Transportation Engineers are good people and stopping accidents is just good engineering.

Thanks “Mr Engineer” and for posting this!I remember your thread on r/cars and I am really happy for you! I find it amazing that you can get results from Reddit with a single thread.

Can’t wait to find out what exactly they will be doing, thanks for sharingStuff like this is why I keep using reddit. Reddit doesn't always knock it out of the park but this moment surely did it.!remindme 2 monthsCan't wait to see the final result!!Reddit can be awesome sometimes.u/remindmebot 4 monthsReally cool that might get fixed. There is a curve near where I live that has that problem. It is on a country road. I was one of them that screwed up on the curve. It isnbanked opposite of what it should be. It is one of those gravel amd tar country roads. It wasn't raining anymore but the road was still kinda glossy, it was night time and I had close to bald tires. It was a shoet s curve and caught me off guard. I corrected my way through It but got to the end, had my tires pointing forward when the back ones grabbed traction and pushed me into the ditch. I hit a utility pole with the corner of my car and it scraped down the side, hit the tire that was still pointing down the road and spun me. 

I am older and more experienced now but so make sure I dont let my tires get down that far on tread anymore...!remindme 6 Monthsr/bestofThis is a crazy story! Glad the city is looking into it!Very cool!!That’s badass! Super glad that he reached out to you and is hopeful about getting the green light. Seems crazy someone like him wasn’t contacted by police after all those accidents, but hell if a Reddit post is what it takes to get stuff done then I’m super glad you made that post. Shout out to anonymous Mr. Engineer who is literally attempting to save lives!!I’d have planted a few large sturdy trees. I probably still would, just to be certain.Good job, both of you.The GDT needs to improve its accessibility!Woah omg and this takes place in my home state of Georgia?! Love to see itRemindMe! 6 monthspretty common seen it before

it is hard to get money to change roads

but accidents, injury, and death on a sliding scale simplify that processNice! Sounds allot like my house my mom lives at. When you pull into her subdivision there is a curve almost right away and at night people don't see it I guess and always drive into the house right in front of it. I remember they put light deflectors along the house not sure if that helped them much.As an engineer, this sounds to me like the engineers are trying to cover their own assess so they don't get taken to court.Not going to lie though. Over a month of construction on the main road to your house is going to be annoying. Do everyone a favor and look up flagger hand signals. You don’t want to be the jerk who drives through fresh asphaltI’ve seen more get done on reddit in terms of public productivity in the last 6 months then I have anywhere else, this really is an interesting placeReddit ftwAbout 30 miles from my home, huge granite boulders dot the landscape.  I've seen occasional homes with a few of these strategically located in their front or side yards.  I've not asked, but it's pretty clear to me that these are truck-stoppers:  boulders well rooted in the ground that simply won't move when struck by a suburban assault vehicle.  Since there have been a number of accounts of cars hitting houses and businesses, including one that was launched by a berm into the second floor of a business, I feel these homeowners made wise decisions in their "landscaping."This is great to hear.  Kudos to you Mr/Ms Georgia DOT Engineer.In Miami-Dade we have an app called “see click fix” or something. You take a photo of the flooded area or problem in the app and people come out to fix it within days. I’ve used it myself and it works so well it’s like magic.This is great! Love to see the final product although I'm sure it will take an eternityGreat news.  I was wondering if they would put up a sign.That’s so cool! Shout out to Mr.Engineer!hey thats pretty cool!That's really fucking cool! I legitimate feel good story.

Followingthats good my buddy got arrest while posting stuff on reddit, ymmv!I am eager to get those learning materials! -Signed, another Engineer friend... But one that doesn't do roads... Yet.The process by which roads are engineered is quite boring. Thanks for being interested.

It sounds like speeding is a factor in most of these crashes. Hopefully the changes will help the situation. Depending on driveways and such in the curve, I wonder if guard rail could be needed. I guess if the other changes don't slow drivers down, it could help.Man, what is wrong with Georgia Department of Transportation that they could not notice this trend on their own?

And why are law enforcement agencies responding to all the accidents not going to GDOT (or whatever) with the trend?

Ridiculously incompetent all around.

I don't know why but it caught my eyeYou mean to say that posting to Reddit actually resolved your problem?!?! 

Man I love the internet sometimesWell that's dope.Very cool. Will follow with intrigue RemindMe! 180 daysWtf is this pictureThis is an amazing result!

Our old house was at the junction of two busy roads.  One of them, a county road, also had a narrow bridge alongside the back of our property.  In ten years, we had well over twenty accidents with varying results and severity.  It got to the point that we would hear that sickening crunch, grab our go bag specifically packed for this purpose while calling 911.  After one driver came out of his truck cab belligerent and threatening to me, I added a weapon to my standard operating procedure (I have a permit and extensive training). One time a helicopter landed in my yard.  My chickens didn’t lay eggs for three days afterward.

The only one that really upset me was a young guy who was texting while drunk in the middle of the day and ended up missing the bridge, ending up hung up in the trees right above the area where my kids played.  We could have been out there playing in the creek that time of day.

Now we live on the same road, but a few miles away.  We still get people stopping because they ran out of gas or their car broke down a few times a week, but it’s way better than the accidents.That was super nice of that person to reach out. Also, props for the trim!!!Beautifulthis is wildly coolExcellent.I think I didn't share in your original post. But over near Birmingham(AL) we have a curve that is sort of similar. It's not on a road where people would be going as fast, but it's suddenly downhill and turn and so the house in the curve has had cars hit it multiple times over the years.Awesome!Strange, is your road a state road? I've spoken to both state and county DOTs before to get a better understanding of who is responsible for what. If it is a state road, highway or Interstate, then it is the state DOT. If it is a county road (not city) or even a small segment in county for Interstate then the county DOT is responsible. BTW, I live in GA, Gwinnett county.

I read your original posting when it came out. Made me think of a neighbor just outside my subdivision. The curve is almost like a right/left turn lane on a suburban two-lane road. From one direction where you must steer as if turning a lazy left, most times people just have too much speed and run out of road.

The property owner, now a widow, has had his mason mailbox replaced at least ten times in the twenty years I've lived near him, and several times his mason and iron fence. Being a county road, the county just won't address the issue. But here is the Gwinnett DOT kicker ...

A handful of months back on a rainy night (no t-storms, just rain), someone approached that curve from the other direction. Heck, they didn't see the curve and tried to go straight, which they did up until they hit the new-ish telephone pole, taking it out, and hitting the brand new concrete pad for I-85's monitoring pole and boxes.

Still, no effort by any DOT to put in guard rails. Ain't GA & Gwinnett great?thats awesomeWhy do people ask about your house? ANyhow thanks for the tour and nice house!The goat picture is super cool.  You're right to be proud of that one.Probably too late to notice but op, not a bad idea to seek some counseling for the fatality wrecks. That stuff sneaks up on you when you last expect it. Trust me.Does OP sound like Skweezy Jibbs to anyone else?

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCIPkVWmiR0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCIPkVWmiR0)So a friend has this same situation. No deaths yet but frequent accidents. Fortunately for them they end up in a relatively soft cranberry bog. Fortunately for him he make thousands with every accident. Town, county or state could care less.Great job, Reddit!MaxThat's awesome to hear. That's good that road is state maintained.That’s so great! I’m happy you got the change you wantedAny updates?I just hope those deer on the wall were actuslly eaten and not just killed for funDoug you posted about the Volga almost 6 months ago, when is that video coming out?Hi Doug. I'm from New Zealand. In 1995 I flew to San Diego for a vacation with my family and had a cheese burger at a place called Hodads. It was the best burger I've ever had.  Does Hodads still exist?Hey Doug!

You get to build a Frankencar with any manufacturer's styling, power train, electronics and 3 of your favorite quirks.  What monstrosity would you birth into the world?What is the quirkiest “doug is the type of a guy” comment you’ve ever read?!Doug first of all I want to thank you for frequently answering my car questions and comments in the biweekly Doug video posts. Therefore I want to ask you something not car related for this AMA. 

I gotta ask. What draws you to Gilmore Girls?Hi Doug. I realize this is r/cars, but are you planning to do anymore house reviews in the future? Perhaps once the pandemic is over? Zillow fever is real.Why Nantucket?  What draws you to that place so often?  Seriously.  I have never been, but you seem to be there all the time. My wife and I love to travel so maybe you can tell me why we should visit it?OMG I caught this early! Can't think of a clever question, though, so I'll go with what my heart tells me:

Considering your review of the Unimog last Dougcember, and the Camera Cayenne last week, are you open to reviewing quirks and features of more non-conventional vehicles? Such as big rigs and buses. Always thought it'd be fun to see the little things we don't consider about those vehicles! And not because I'm an Euro Truck Simulator nerd.

Keep up the amazing work! Always a pleasure to have a fresh vid by lunch time.Hi Doug, 

Do you notice much difference between the owners of more expensive cars you review (Paganis, Bugattis, etc) and the less expensive (Yugo, Custom Cruiser, etc) or are gearheads gearheads regardless of price range?What is your favorite burrito place in San Diego?What's your favourite rice dish?Hi Doug! Thanks for doing this AMA.

What’s your “never meet your heroes” story with a car? Have you ever driven or reviewed a car for which you had great expectations and it ended up being a disappointment?Hi Doug, when you first moved to my area (San Diego) I remember binging your videos one night after more than a few drinks and sending an email offering my Honda Fit for review. The next morning I looked at it and realized it was probably the stupidest thing I ever wrote. I imagine you get 100s of these, so my question is, whats the most useless car you were ever offered to review? Or most memorable?Hi Doug! Thanks again for taking time out of your day to speak with everyone. 

How has Cars and Bids been going relative to your early expectations, and what would you say are the biggest challenges that come with running a site like that?

Thanks so much, big fan!Hi Doug. Did you know that you have a car dealer shop called DeMuro Cars in American Truck Simulator video game as part of the Utah DLC?Some questions

1. Is there ANY car(s) you would fly across the world to review?
2. If Mercedes brings back the G Cabriolet with the new bodystyle G-Wagon, would you buy one?
3. What gear do you use to film your videos.
4. Any car buying tips ?
5. Any plans to go on Vinwiki to tell car stories?
6. What is the best car to go on curvy roads, backroads etc.

Thanks for this AMA Doug and have a great dayWhat's the quirkiest quirk you've ever seen in any car?[deleted]Favorite episode of Gilmore Girls?Hey Doug! 

Thanks for doing this AMA. I really enjoy your videos and your other content.

I just have a few questions if you don't mind.

How do you separate your personal life from your "YouTube" life when so many other content creators get sucked in and overstep that line?

When is the "offroading in my Defender" video coming?

What you think about states like Massachusetts and California banning the sale of new ICE cars in 2030?

What is your favorite video game(If you play any)?

When is the Gemera vid coming?

Really love your videos man!Doug, thanks for joining us!

How do you handle the intense negativity that comes with having your content on the internet? I can only imagine the types of "feedback" you get from people that are simply mean... do you find that you have to skip reading the comment sections entirely, or are you able to brush off those folks?Hi Doug, 

What "international" car or brand do you wish to review, that just isn't available in the US?Greetings, Doug! Big fan of your videos and your personality.

My question is this: How do you choose where to shoot your videos? In some cases it's obvious, like when a dealer has a purpose-built room for it, but in other cases you're just in some random parking lot. If the owner/dealer doesn't have a convenient place for you, where do you decide to go and why?Doug, what's your favorite quirk/feature about yourself?Hi Doug, have you watched any of Less Doug DeMuro's videos? they're hilariousLet's do a hypothetical question.In ten years, do you think you will have any of the cars you currently do? Will, perhaps, the whole lineup be sold at some point for other vehicles, new and old?When is the ISF video coming? Can't wait for my car to get ripped to shreds.Hey Doug! Thanks for the reviews, work, and being available to us car dorks.


How vital was moving to California (because of weather and car availability I am assuming?) for you to do this as a career?

Do you think doing this is possible in a place with less car availability and/or more pronounced winters?Hey Doug, what are your thoughts on performance wagons outside of the German varieties? Anything forgotten by the masses worth looking into?

Ignore my flair :pHey Doug! I really like your channel and appreciate the fact that you respond to almost all queries on social media. Thank you for doing this AMA.   


How much free time do you have Doug? You push out many videos a week some of which are almost 30 minutes long, you run a huge car auction website where you provide your comments on every car listed there, and from what I've seen you reply to lots of comments on your social media. How do you manage to do everything at the same time?Hi Doug. 

What was the catalyst to you falling in love with cars? Were you introduced by your parents or other family members or was it a passion you discovered independently, through your own means?Hi Doug, I'm from Detroit, Michigan and a huge fan! I notice a lot of cars you review from companies from Michigan (Ford, Jeep) have MI manufacturer plates on them. Have you ever flown to Michigan to review something?Has making the automotive scene a full time job taken away any of your passion towards it as a hobby?

I’m in the process of turning a hobby into a career and this is one of the things that worries me the most.

Big fan since the old days, thanks for all the content!Do you ever worry about running out of cars to review? Or at least running out of a variety so you aren't only reviewing only the latest year's models?Has a member of Jimmy Eat World (or a relative of Jimmy Eat World) ever sent you an email?  I'm hoping this is the most realistic condition of your 3 hour email policy.

[http://www.dougdemuro.com/contact](http://www.dougdemuro.com/contact)Hi Doug, 

Couple of quick questions to noodle over...First of all, I'm a big fan...that said:

1) What car(s) are you hoping to own in the not-too-distant future?

2) Have you ever considered reviewing multiple generations of the same car concurrently to compare the evolution of the model? I'm thinking back-to-back 3-series or Subaru WRXs etc., with reviews that delve deeper than stats and specs - discussing how the models *feel* differently.

3) Finally - I appreciated your break down of how/why you spec'd your new Defender - some features for uniqueness, some of for resale value. My question is: Do you now regret getting the front bench seat instead of the center console? This is a safe space, you can be honest like Rory Gilmore would...I know you said you'll never sell it so it's a moot point but I would figure 90% of people considering buying your vehicle would prefer the 3rd row of seating and the center console.Hey Doug!

I know you’ve said before that some cars you review simply because you like them, even though you know they may not perform so well on your channel. My question is, what’s the peak of this? What would be the car you most want to review/drive, knowing it would just absolutely bomb on your channel?Hi Doug! Any chance we can get a behind-the-scenes video going into how your actual videos are produced, from scheduling to shooting to editing and everything in between? Ideally not just you explaining how it works, but actually kinda shadowing yourself on camera for the day, if at all possible. I know a vlog is not really your style, but I think it would make a fascinating More Doug video.Hey Doug,

Are you team Logan or team Jess? What was your thoughts on the "Year in the life" series and do you wish they could pick up the series again?

Edit* I meant to say team LoganThank you for Cars and Bids.  It is my most frequented site and it's always interestingHi Doug, 2 questions:

1) I was thinking of opening my own auction website for toilets and toilet accessories, what do you think of the name CansAndBidets.com?

2) What do you think of the Nissan Juke / Juke Nismo? It's certainly a weird 'experimental' car so on one hand I could see you loving it, or in practice is it just so bad that there is nothing to love?

Thanks for taking the time to do an AMA!Inevitably electric cars are the future and while you've praised the Model 3 before, it seems like you've never owned one. 


Do you see yourself switching over in the future? Or is your Defender going to be your goto as long as possible.What’s the most elusive car you’ve been trying to review?Hi /u/Doug-Demuro
!

In general what features do you see being added to CarsAndBids in the future?

BringATrailer just announced adding shipping to their platform. Do you have a response to that? Plus, any plans to integrate a payment or escrow system into CarsAndBids, as well as a system for cross border vehicles and shipping?

TIAHey Doug. Huge fan! (Loved the Audi TT video you did a while back) This is a short one but what is a car you once owned that you sold and now regret selling, and why you regret selling it and would you ever buy it again.Can you please review a Merkur!!Hey Doug!

So I finally just did! https://www.instagram.com/p/CJbgBLSMwfgHey Doug!  Long time reader/watcher (since you started at Jalopnik!) and former resident of the areas you sometimes filmed in the Philly suburbs.

You mentioned a while back during one of your reviews that environmental issues are important to you.  Do you consider environmental impact when you're buying your own cars for your personal use?  Any chance of us seeing an electric, hybrid, or other alternative fuel vehicle join your fleet?Hey Doug, huge fan! But I have to ask, why have you been avoiding Chicago? There are so many amazing cars here so I didn’t know if you were avoiding the area for some reason or it was just a coincidence that nothing had piqued your interest in the Chicago area.Hi Doug!

I currently drive a 30th anniversary MX-5. It's a wonderful car and it brings a smile to my face every time I drive it.

Which other cars out there best capture that MX-5 feel and turn it up to 11?Hey Doug! Thanks for doing this.

What was the most over-engineered quirk/feature you have ever seen on a vehicle?Hey Doug! You being the honest car reviewer that you are, have given some mostly positive reviews to cars like the Kia Stinger, and even bought one, despite the terrible reputation those things seem to have in the car community from my experience. What’s the most unpopular car in the eyes of the enthusiast community, that you actually liked and went against common consensus on?What’s the story behind your *heart*629MEE plate?Who do you think is going to have the best electric truck offering in the next 5-10 years?Hi doug! When do you update the dougscore charts on your website? Do you do it every couple months or is it random?Hey Doug, been a fan since the old “getting gas in my Ferrari 360” video. Gotta love the YouTube algorithm. 

Have you ever had an experience reviewing a car where the vehicle was just a complete disaster? Like features not working, faulty hardware, breakdowns etc? Or in a similar vein, have you ever had to scrap a review mid shoot or in post production for similar reasons?Hi Doug! If cars randomly all disappeared overnight, what do you think you’d do instead going forward? You always seem to make some good quick jokes, would you go into comedy?I don’t have a question but a statement: you’re the best, Doug!

What's a positive trend that you have seen running theough car manufacturers in the recent years that you hopes continues or grows even larger and more prominant?hi doug, i'm a big fan and I wanted to know why you haven't reviewed the 300ZX yet as it's a pillar of 90s japanese carsHi Doug, I’ve been watching for about 5 years now. I’ve watched you build up your channel and change up your content style and loved it every step of the way. I am wondering what kind of cars you’d recommend for around $10k-$15k for a sporty but reliable car for the northeast.  I have a few in my head but would love your input for some more ideas. Thank you if you get to this question, hope you and your family stay safe!Doug...who do you watch on Youtube? Any non-car interests?Now that you are a San Diego resident, what are the quirks and features here?Hey Doug! High school senior here. I’m probably one of your youngest OG fans having been here since the days of the CTS-V wagon :) I’ve got a few questions for you-

Why Emory? I just applied there as a biology major and you seem to really enjoy staying connected to the school- I watched your alumni feature on the admissions Instagram. I applied partly because of your inspiration...

Will I see you on Nantucket over the summer? I waved to you August 2019 while you were in your yellow Defender (I was in a beige older LR4!)

Will you ever sell the yellow NAS Defender? I feel like you’ve mentioned before that you’d never want to get rid of it, but clearly the G Cabrio does the convertible SUV job a bit better than the NAS. I’d love to buy it if I could!

What would you recommend for a college student studying in the northeast commuting from Long Island to Boston university? Currently have a high mileage 4Runner but with gas prices rising and age taking a toll, I’d like to upgrade to something a bit more comfortable (and cheap!)What car does your wife drive?Hey Doug, big fan of your work and wanted to let you know how you've made cars accessible to a lot of my non car friends!

Two Questions:

Do you ever see the 350Z appreciating greatly as the Fast and Furious amd Need for Speed crowd grows up?

Love the channel, I've been watching for a couple years!What's your favourite Porsche out of all the ones that you've driven?

997 RS4.0 VS 991 911R?Wow...that one reply saying that this would be their last written communication to you.  I didn't think it was possible for a company rep in this day and age to say something like that and get away with it.Worked for a Ford dealer for 9 years, I've had 3 cars disappear on me. One big issue is you have to figure out who fucked up, the numerous Shippers, Ford, railyard, etc. Then trying to get your dealership to get in touch with the right person, good luck. Just gets passed off onto someone else.


I had a Fiesta that took 11 months to arrive, because someone stole the battery for it at the factory. Why couldn't they just get a new battery? Who the hell knows. 


Also your car could've been damaged and they don't wanna tell you or your dealer so they decided to start from scratch on a new car.[deleted]4 possibilities:

1) your car was stolen from port (probably by Ziggy Sobotka)

2) your car was damaged in shipping

3) your car was sold to another customer (whether accidentally or knowingly)

4) your car, and others like it, have some kind of defect that needs to be resolved and they are fixing it. given that this is a low-volume, high-performance car, and given that there are other people in the same boat as you (pun intended!), I would lean towards this being the most likely explanation.They pulled similar delays with /u/thesmokingtireSomething similar happened when I got my car a few years ago. They said they got the order, it was customized to my specifications at the factory and would be here on the next ground transport. My dad worked pretty close to the dealership and could see when they unload the cars. He went in to pickup the car the next time he saw the ground transport unloading. No car, went in talked with the guy, he said there was a delay, 8 weeks later, got the car and turned out they shipped the car to the wrong port and couldn't find the car. Was two states down and had to ship it on the next open spot back up. To their credit, the car still had less then 10 miles on delivery.Wow. I read that whole article. Sounds really shady. Does Ford do the shipping/transporting themselves or a 3rd party?  

Wow and to actually tell you they will no longer communicate with you about it?! 

What options do you have? I'd send one last email stating you're getting a lawyer and going to the media if you don't have your car in a week. Or at the very least, get answers by that time, as I'm sure you have proof of the transaction.

This is really shitty dude. That happened to me on the delivery of a pickup truck from a different manufacturer. What I finally figured out is that the vehicle was badly damaged during shipment and repaired while I waited. When I decided years later to have the paint redone, the body guy showed me.[deleted]Wow what the fuck. You need to make some noise, so much noise Ford has to deal with it. Email non-stop, tweet, facebook, everything. 

It is absolutely ridiculous that in 2016, a company as big as Ford can make a mistake like this. Just wondering, did you go through with canceling the order? 

Lawyer up.OP you need to ask them to pull detailed In Transit reports. >Newark, New Jersey    
    
Yeah, lost may not be the right word.I had complete track of a 5 dollar decal I ordered the other month from production to delivery.

Absolutely unacceptable that a company as big as Ford could fumble what is supposed to be an expensive limited run vehicle.

Good luck OP. That's some serious bs.Jalopnik eats this stuff up, and often gets results. Definitely pass your story along to them, and good luck!My brother is still waiting for his RS as well. He was told April/may timeframe and now has no idea. Ford did the same to me with my Focus ST. Ended up arriving about two months after it was supposed to, and some issues I had with the car lead me to believe that something happened to it either during transit or at the factory. 

Get used to it -- welcome to the Ford ownership experience. I work in the auto industry (with over a decade sales and service) and this is what we refer to as "fell off the truck".

It was damaged in shipping and is in a body shop. I guarantee it. Yeah get the sti!Amazon lost my package the other day so I totally get how you feel man.I've seen people reach out to local news stations to complain and ask assistance regarding the matter, and that normally tends to get fire under the offender's feet. Also, I'll share on my Facebook. I have about 4 thousand friends throughout the country on there, I'll tell people to share as well

Edit: Just shared itYou mentioned you're from Seattle, what dealer so I know who to avoid when I pick myself up either this or a mustangAt one time Newark was known as the stolen car capital of the world, they even made a movie about it, New Jersey Drive.The vehicle was shipped either by rail and was un loaded or not in a rail yard. That rail yard is run by companies called Inter Rail or Calibur Auto transfer or something along those lines. Newark port maybe it came in a container and they lost it? Google these companies in and around Newark where the car was un loaded and call them and give them the VIN 

I work in vehicle logistics and do this everyday locating vehicles and ship from there to people and dealers pm me the vin if you like I have connections in Newark and other places or basically I know how to go about it finding or hey maybe u have and in talking out of my was but by golly I so this everyday [deleted]Just watched Michael K. Williams new show Black Market on VICE and the very first episode is about how Newark, New Jersey has tons of violent carjackings. Some just steal what they can get but others have orders on certain types of cars. Not saying your car was stolen but it's also not out of the question.

[Here is the best link I can find of that episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b24mjmyTNmk)[deleted]Have you connected with other people who had RS's built on the same day as yours?  If so, are any of them experiencing the same delay?  I had a similar issue when I ordered my Mustang.  The car was delivered to the rail yard and there it sat.  Ford would not let the dealership pick it up.  They would not tell me or the dealership why nor would they give an ETA on when it would be released.  After a while Ford finally came out with a recall notice (something related to the seat belts) but still wouldn't give an ETA.My Dad had this happen when he ordered his Mustang GT. They had all these excuses of why it was taking so long to be delivered and then it was all of a sudden at the dealer. Don't know exactly what happened, but this is nothing new for Ford. Fucked

Over

Refused

DeliveryI am seeing this late, so I apologize. I know how you feel because my RS was stuck in port and then in the mod center for well over two months. Car built 4/22 landed in NJ May 9th and I finally picked it up from the dealer on 7/15. Join focusrs.org and ask for help there. Lots of good folks will lend a hand. This has been a reoccurring problem with Ford for a very long time. 

When the current gen Explorer first arrived, a family friend ordered one. *Eight* months later, he received his vehicle. This was after it sat at this warehouse and that warehouse and the other warehouse before finally making it to the dealer. Just like your situation, no one could tell him anything and his vehicle was "In Transit" for all of those months. 

Just recently, my father ordered an F150 for his business. He was literally told by the dealer that they don't do deliveries, and he is also not allowed to come pick it up himself. What?! So it's just going to sit there for eternity? Apparently so. Ianal, though I work with high level corporate sales and shipping.

I would immediatley demand to see the interaction process between your dealers sales manager and their corporate territory rep. I beleive they're blowing smoke up your ass when saying they can't contact corporate.

I'd also contact a lawyer about what precedent there has been for class action law suits and new, special edition cars. You clearly have a rapport with other owners suffering the same horse hockey. Someone at the dealer is lying to you, and something can be done to get a definite answer. Otherwise, you could have the news there.OP post an update when you hear back from Ford!That email......holy fuck......

For a living i do purchasing of pretty pricey servers/switch etc. Usually my reps handle the exchange of ETA information (that i give them and they relay to the customer) but on some of our higher priority accounts i will specifically give the buyers ETA.

I can't fathom for a second telling a customer (even if i didn't like them) "don't know where your item is, also this is our last communication regarding it". That is absolutely insane and i'd expect to be fired the next day. 

I'm a ford fan boy thru and thru but this is probably one of the worst CS experiences i've read lately. Hopefully this post does get some traction and Ford gets you some answers ASAPI had money down on mine before the order banks opened and just got it Friday.  It's actually slightly different than the one I ordered.  From what the dealership told me, my order got dropped from the system somehow.  They had another similar order come in and gave me the option to buy it since my order was in months before the other person.  Ford has had no idea what is going on with the orders.   The whole time no one could tell me where my car was.  Must have *drifted* back out to sea!Ordered an RS the day the order banks opened in October of last year.  My car has been sitting at the shipping company's location in Newark for the past two weeks...  This is not helping my confidence...My 2011 Ford focus has been a nightmare. The sync system always stops working evey few weeks (I have to manually hard reset it by pulling the fuse out and putting it back in), the latch on the back door broke even though I never have passengers and only used the door a handful of times, and the transmission went out within two months of buying the car. Thank God I bought the extended warranty, and props to the service tech at the dealership who has always helped me out, but cmon, a certified used car shouldn't have that many problems within the first six months of purchase. When it works its not a bad car, but it seems something is always wrong with it. No worries they sold it to someone that they had a higher mark up on. It wasn't this one was it?

http://www.focusrs.org/forum/attachments/27394d1468546694-who-s-faust-what-s-second-rs-wrecked.jpgGet your money back and let them keep the car , that's the solution if ~~fire~~ Ford can't get it together, might as well buy a different brand I ordered in December, and I still don't have production date. 

:( Perhaps x-post this over in r/legaladvice. Somebody over there is sure to have pointers and information regarding your options in the way of lawyers and such unpleasantries. And the more the story gets around, the more it damages ford's reputation and the more likely they become to get off their lazy asses and do somethingAm I the only one who has figured this out?  
Someone else is driving your car man.  
Plain and simple. Some asshole Ford big suit wanted one or wanted to give one to his nephew or his buddy or some other big suit important somebody.  
Yours is suddenly "waiting for production" and the car you were tracking has been signed over and is owned by someone else.  
The real kicker? I bet the guy who owns it didn't even pay for it. If you think I'm saying this to hurt your feelings, I am. I think the only way for this to gain traction and become a thing is if we really blow it up. Like every time a Focus RS or Ford related *anything* comes up, the first question we ask is where are the missing Focus RS's that people have been waiting for and what happened to Kevin Flynn's car?  
PS: You're awesome by the way. The way you merged with Klu to free Sam and stop them from coming into our world at the end of Tron Legacy. Took real balls.  
Anyway, someone else is driving your car. You can give up trying to find "it" and start with the real big shots. People need to be spamming their twitter. "Where is kpflynn's car? #justiceForTheUser #wheresTheRS"you want exposure? send this to the blog 'jalopnik', I guarantee ford will be calling...
OP, send an email to the writers at jalopnik. Reddit hates gawker (a lot of times rightfully so) but jalopnik can be great. Shoot em an email and go from there. The story might blow up and get you help. So I asked a friend and I was told that there was a known problem and they got assembled and later they'll actually fix the car. It's going to be a major issue like functionality or safety for them to hold your car. Newar NJ? Was it stolen?Shared. I hope it gets around, and that you get your car. This is the kind of thing you forever associate with a brand. 

Ford: We just don't give a shit.> "As previously stated in our correspondence previously.."
> "If additional information are needed.."

What the fuck? Jeffrey is setting the bar awfully low over at Ford's Customer Relationship Center. Not surprising he can't help you, considering he can't put together sentences correctly. Just saw this post after paying $5000 to be considered for a 2017 allocation maybe 4 hours ago. Let the fear begin.Walk awayWhy don't you want to sue?  You're OK with getting screwed out of the money?  

IANAL but its a breach of contract.  You paid money, and never got the good/services....It's very open and shut.  Of course you could wait and see if they come through but they have flat out told you they will have nothing more to do with this so it would seem they do not intend to follow through with their end of the written contract.#FordlostfocusI guess you will just be forced to drive your Lamborghini instead. :-)So nearly the same exact thing happened to my friend. We are in Washington too btw. He paid for his RS cash before they were relased. After he waited and waited flooding Ford with emails Ford told him basically the same thing. He needed to contact the dealer because their records had shown it's been delievered.

He called the dealership and told them what Ford said and he finally got a response on where his car was.

They wanted 10,000 more than what the deal was made for. They were threatening to sell the car to someone else for the price they, now, want and give him a later production.

He had to hire a lawyer. The lawyer sent a letter saying how that specific car belonged to my friend and now the car is sitting  in a lot while he goes to court over it. It's bs. But it IS the dealer doing so. 

I'm am not saying that is what's happening here. As there are big differences in the circumstances. Just letting you know what happened with him.

I am SO sorry that this is happening to you and I hope it gets resolved FAST. This whole thing is making me happy I didn't get an RS. I'll stick with my ST and be happy I avoided the headache. I really hope this blows up and you get answers man.OP, it looks like this thread has gotten you some insiders and others to help you.  Mind giving us an update?

Also, anyone in this thread live in the Dearborn MI area and can show this to someone at the Ford HQ?

If I ordered a car that was produced in North America, I would fucking stand just off the exit door of the factory floor and watch the vin # slowly lurch in my direction."I'm not going to get a lawyer involved or sue. It's just not worth the effort." If you paid for it, and its not worth it to sue, You are literally retarded. I have a feeling you applied for a loan it got denied and they sold the car because you didn't pay for it. Clearly you can't sue. Because if you were in a situation where you could even remotely win, you would. This comment has been overwritten by an open source script to protect this user&apos;s privacy.

The guy is either horrible at his job, or just does not give a shit. He's not trying very hard at all to hide the "fuck you" attitude. Ford has had massive issue before delivering cars, and for some reason it's really bad with the RS. I'm really sorry for your predicament, especially with a 40k plus car... C'mon Ford, how do you lose an entire car. Oh well, I hope you get something figured out soonI am not sure what is worse. That he doesn't have his car or that people are still trying to promote medium. They need to take an adderall to get that focus backI know this comment is going to go off in the void of this comment section (and probably be a repeat of what others have said) but you can't sit complacent with the fact that you are STILL waiting for a car, A CAR! We aren't talking about an Amazon order here, this is an investment. No company should promise you a product and then turn around and cut communication off. The fact that you haven't throw the "I am going to get a lawyer for this" at them yet is astonishing to me. "As previously stated on our correspondence previously..." 

*twitch*Ford :  " you have not received your car  ?  Fuck you "This seems incredibly frustrating. I actually have an anecdote I wanted to share that might be relevant to your story:

About a month or so ago I was shopping around for a new car and stopped into the local Ford dealership looking to try out a Focus ST. Sitting right in the front of the showroom was an RS in Nitrous Blue. The salesman saw me admiring it and told me it'd already been sold to some gentlemen who was out of the country and would be picking it up in about a month.

We got to talking about what I was looking for and I mentioned I wanted to test drive an ST. Seeing that I was interested in the car, he asked if I'd be interested in the RS - the same one that he'd just told me was sold 5 minutes earlier. I told him no thanks, that it was above my budget, and his response? I'm paraphrasing because this was a month ago and I don't remember his exact wording, but essentially he asked me "Are you sure you don't at least want to take it out for a test drive and see if it might be worth the money to you?" I couldn't believe what I just heard, and of course I refused because I had no intention of buying that car and wasn't about to beat on somebody else's car.

But if this Ford dealer had no problem offering up test drives on a "sold" car in hopes of offloading it quicker than the scheduled pickup date, who knows which other dealers operate the same way. This dealer was also bragging about selling GT350s for $15k over MSRP so they may have been particularly scummy, but it really set off warning bells about the way some of these dealers operate and left a bad taste in my mouth overall.
Hey man, that story is horrible. Ford's customer support seems atrocious. 

I would write to "that dude in blue" or "Subaruwrxfan" and tell them your story. They are both big YouTubers in the car scene that drive mustang's, and frequently get cars from Ford for their YouTube channels. 

If you write them, they might make a video that will give Ford some bad press they truly won't want to have.

Fuck this bait and switch from corporate.Newark is car jacking central. 89% sure it was stolen mateYou may want to send your account to The Consumerist (www.consumerist.com).

Have you found your car?Nothing changes, huh Ford? You guys suck and are the reason American car companies are in the shit bind they were in, hat in hand in 09. What the actual fuck FORD?? Trying to claw back and put a dent in the enthusiast market this way, with one of your reps basically telling this guy to fuck off? Fuck Ford. I'll be buying a 2 year old Merc before I'd buy a new Ford with horrible after purchase support. I'd even buy another American car before buying Ford after reading this. Ford Sucks.As an European it still baffles me people in the US put up with shit like paying more than sticker price for a new car... Over here you are an idiot if you even pay sticker price...I won't do x it's not worth the effort.  Please do y for me because I'm too lazy to do x.  

Do your own dirty work op. We all have shit like this happen. > the judge said the defendants overall “produced minimal evidence of good faith efforts” to comply with the law.

Never a good sign.

Yeah, that's a paddlin'.Roll coal taxTheir attorney's name is fucking Cole Cannon. Truth is stranger than fiction.So I guess it *IS* illegal to manufacture or sell parts or components for motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines that bypass, defeat, or render inoperative elements of design that were installed by the vehicle or engine original equipment manufacturer to comply with CAA emission standards?

Gosh if only we had known. If only.If you've ever seen these guys' shop, 800K is nothing for them. They have their own helicopters, warehouses with 200K+ worth of Polaris RZR UTVs. You name it. 

Dave (the owner of SMCO) is building like a 6 million dollar house in Utah right now. The lot alone is worth a million dollars (public record). 

Compared to the money they've made with their TV show and building their brand through diesel, this is just a small cost of business.I have lost count of the number of delete reversals I have done now that the Ontario provincial government has started cracking down on commercial vehicles with deletes.im a car guy, i love fast, loud, cool cars, but i never understood the point of rolling coal. I think that is one of the dumbest things in car culture, even more than ridiculous cambered wheels.And this is why Gale Banks is still the OG diesel tuner. A clean burn is a full burn.And yet they're still not being forced to repair the vehicles they sold with emission-delete modifications.Diesel emission deletes are getting a bit ridiculous now. Everyone I know with a diesel truck deletes them, even on brand new 70k+ trucks. 

Tune, alright that's one thing. But just deleting emissions and tuning on brand new trucks is a bit overkill. The same goes for people who go catless instead of high-flow cats on regularly driven vehicles. Too far and ruining it for everyone.

Edit: ITT, a bunch of people justifying their delete to me because it “sucks” and “gets less power and mpg”.

The truck clearly advertised its power and economy. If you need to completely delete important emissions equipment to be satisfied with you truck  then don’t buy it.

Edit2: turns out diesel trucks are how truck guys pretend they are better then other truck guys.Good coal rolling is the dumbest car mod out there.Proof that rolling coal is for idiots.It takes a special kind of asshole to say “I want to be as obnoxious as possible and intentionally alter my vehicle to belch choking, disgusting, clouds of noxious black smoke into the air.”Anyone rolling coal is fucking trash.I’m all for the war on (rolling) coal.Also fine the tv channel / production company for encouraging such behavior and profiting from it.It's a good start.Now all they need to do is fine the Giant corrupt companies polluting the ocean and air with no reprocussions. It would also be awesome if the US would switch to a better and cleaner energy source like nuclearDiscovery channel. Way to go abandoning nature docs for this hillbilly garbage.Good. Coal rollers enjoy giving everyone the finger. Time to give it to them back. In spades.Lmao get fucked dieseltards[deleted]Fantastic news. I've seen their show a few times and I can honestly say that these guys are _the biggest douchebags I've seen for a while_

They make me nostalgic for Richard Rawlings and the Gas Monkey knobheadsIn Ontario, we have a new special force that looks for diesel vehicles that have had emission deletes and pulls them off the road and issues $25,000 minimum fines to the owner and also the shop that did the delete if they can find them.Good riddance! Shit like that needs to go away anyway.A bad day for fuckwits who intentionally pollute extra.

A good day for the rest of us.Smog in Salt Lake City, UT and surrounding areas is a serious problem. Over 50% of the smog in SLC (where I've lived for more than half a decade) is due to vehicle emissions. Performant cars are fun, but performance should not come at at the cost of producing one of of the worst types of pollution  (pm-2.5). Diesel vehicles are some of the worst offenders. I'm a car enthusiast (I own a Focus ST and a C3 Corvette), but cheating emissions tests is a slap in the face to everyone who has to breathe the air in the Salt Lake City area.

If this was out in Bumfuck, UT, or some other rural area, then it wouldn't be as much of an issue.  As I mentioned SLC already has a very serious air quality problem, which likely influenced the judge's decision.Serves those stupid assholes right. These people always try to roll coal in my face when im riding top down. 

Pure scum.Ah HAHAHAHAHA!!!

I've never seen their show, but these idiots got exactly what they deserved.Hate these trucks on the road.I’d be so embarrassed to drive one of those abominationsSay hypothetically, I hooked a mister of atomized VX behind my car, got in front of someone rolling coal, and unleashed just enough to take 30-40% off their lifespans. Would that be unethical?Only turds drive these kinds of trucks.  I have a raised Comanche '86 and take it off roading whenever I get the opportunity.  Whenever these glamour trucks drive by and rev their engines I just laugh because they'll NEVER take that busted up ass tard wagon on the rocks.Is it the same one who thought it'd be a good idea to create an extra fluid for diesels that's shipped in millions of PLASTIC containers? 🤦Should just round that up to $1milli never did understand these people. particulate pollution gives everyone's kids asthma, not just "prius driving treehuggers". 

i literally can't comprehend what they're doing.Good.

As much as I love cars, some of this shit needs to get reeled in.

Its kind of like software piracy  - it's one thing if one person does it for their own personal use.  It's a whole other thing when a company does it that makes a profit from doing it.  

Unfortunately  I am sure the car - especially  the truck - community won't see it that way and they'll wrongly think that it's the big bad gob'ment  out to get them.I know a few people that have deleted the emissions on some diesels they all only did it after it failed on them the second time. $2300 to fix crap that will likely fail again or $1800 to delete crap and not have to worry about it again and no longer have to buy DEF?Good! I don’t speak for all big lifted truck owners obviously but a lot are just total tools; always on your ass (doesn’t matter how much over the limit you’re doing, they just want to be in front of you), I’ve seen on multiple occasions by multiple perpetrators purposely “coal rolling” pedestrians. Just total pieces of shit, a good amount of them. Again, not all are like this but more often than not this is what I observe. So with all that in mind in addition to all the pollution violations, this was well deserved. Maybe these dudes weren’t like that, though. And I’m perfectly open to being proven wrong in that regard!For those in the EU:

SALT LAKE CITY — The Diesel Brothers reality TV stars must pay $848,000 for modifying, marketing and selling pickup trucks with emission control defeat devices installed, a judge has ruled.

U.S. District Judge Robert Shelby also issued a permanent injunction barring the Diesel Brothers from further violations, which he said stemmed from unlawful operations that still are economically enriching the defendants.

Those benefits continue, Shelby said in his ruling issued late Friday, “extending well beyond the profits from these prohibited activities to defendants’ status as television and social media celebrities, the reputation and notoriety of their brands, and the economic leverage they have used to accumulate assets and start new businesses.”

The ruling detailed about 400 violations in which the defendants bypassed systems designed to reduce emissions of particulate matter and nitrogen oxides from diesel vehicles.

Most of the $848,000 must be paid to the U.S. Treasury, according to Clean Air Act guidelines that allow citizens to file civil enforcement actions against polluters. But Shelby further ruled that $90,000 will go to the Davis County Tampered Diesel Truck Restoration Program.

The ruling is a victory for Utah Physicians for a Healthy Environment, which sued the Diesel Brothers after seeing modified trucks spewing black smoke on the Wood Cross-based truck enthusiasts’ Discovery Channel show, now in its sixth season.

“Illegally stripped down and modified diesel trucks have no place on our roadways,” Dr. Brian Moench, president of the doctors’ group, said Monday afternoon in a press release. “Any business that not only profits from doing that, but glorifies the plumes of pollution that their handiwork produces, should be held accountable, and that’s what this ruling does.”

Physicians’ attorney Reed Zars on Monday applauded the “lifetime ban” on further emissions violations. He also noted the judge’s ruling ordered that none of the $848,000 “can be avoided or charged in bankruptcy.”

Cole Cannon, the Diesel Brothers’ attorney, said it is too soon to know whether they will appeal the ruling.

“What’s disappointing is that the parties were unable to resolve this through a private settlement, which would have resulted in a lot more of a restorative effort in Utah,” Cannon said. “This order only has approximately 10% of the money staying in Utah. The other gets sent to Washington, D.C., and we all know how useful that’s going to be.”

In court documents leading up to the decision, the doctors’ group had sought more than $1 million in penalties and argued that the law allowed sanctions up to $4.4 million.

But Shelby gave the Diesel Brothers credit for various mitigating factors, such as that they earned only about $1,500 direct profit per truck of the 50 vehicles sold or given away in online sweepstakes during the five-year period addressed in the suit.

While David Sparks, owner of the defendant companies involved and the main star of the TV show, added a disclaimer on the program saying they did not support illegal truck modifications, the judge said the defendants overall “produced minimal evidence of good faith efforts” to comply with the law.

Shelby said the Diesel Brothers have not restored or offered to restore any of the tampered trucks they gave away in sweepstakes and that two trucks with defeat devices were sold even after the judge imposed a preliminary injunction.

The defendants can afford to pay the penalties, Shelby added, outlining in his ruling the assets of Sparks, know as “Heavy D” on the show, and his companies.

Sparks has become a celebrity with millions of social media followers and his income has “substantially increased” to an average of $300,000 annually in the last three years, the judge said.

Sparks received $482,597 in that period from Discovery Channel alone, according to the ruling.

The Sparks Motors truck dealership doubled its assets from 2016 to 2018 and at the end of that period had a helicopter and two planes.

Shelby largely discounted one key defense the Diesel Brothers offered regarding the magnitude of the penalties sought, that many of the defeat parts and trucks they sold ended up outside Utah.

“Defendants’ violations are no less serious simply because they exported their violations to other parts of the country,” Shelby wrote. “The violations were numerous, occurred over a long period of time, significantly increased the toxic pollutants emitted by diesel trucks, and pose a serious risk to human health. At bottom, the tampered trucks and the defeat parts continue to endanger human health, regardless of where they are.”

The judge said the doctors’ group demonstrated that the Diesel Brothers caused irreparable injury by increasing the amounts of toxic pollutants breathed by Northern Utah residents and that monetary damages can’t compensate for injuries suffered.

Seven Utah counties repeatedly have not met federal air pollution standards, especially on the Wasatch Front. The doctors’ groups says ozone and fine-particulate pollution emitted by diesel engines cause various health problems including cancer.

Sparks in the owner of Diesel Brothers affiliated companies including B&W Motors, doing business as Sparks Motors in Woods Cross, and Diesel Power Gear, the online merchandizing arm. Those entities also are defendants in the suit.

Other individual defendants are Diesel Brothers stars Joshua Stuart, “Redbeard”; and Keaton Hoskins, “The Muscle.”

Cannon said he was “shocked” that Shelby assessed $86,100 in penalties against Hoskins for selling two tampered trucks, only one of which he worked on.

“I think for a regular truck owner this would be pretty alarming to you,” he said.

Shelby also awarded litigation costs and attorneys’ fees to the doctors’ group, which will be determined in future hearings.

-----Sucks to be those idiots.They should have slapped a fine print sticker on the trucks that said "for off road use only"what pieces of shit

hopefully this ruins themThis is what they get for talking shit on my old truckSorry these guys are idiots.That fine is a joke and it shows that America is a joke[deleted]How did Discover Channel escape liability for airing shows that promote illegal activity for their profit.  I’ve seen Diesel Brothers shows air that specifically demonstrated rolling coal modifications, without so much as an acknowledgement by the hosts or a legal disclaimer by the network.

I feel like they should have been complicit in supporting the airing of a how to on breaking the law.It’s funny to see the polarizing comments here compared to a few of the “car communities” I’m in on Facebook. It’s such a dumb thing. Dumping excessive amounts of fuel and burning money to not add performance or fuel economy but to look cool.GoodPunishment should fit the crime. That fine is way to small for causing irreparable harm to the atmosphere.Just a personal belief, but I think anyone caught intentionally rolling coal should have their truck crushed and license revoked.Why do these fuckheads have a reality TV show?I've had low T smoothbrains in lifted diesels roll coal into my open windows on the road more than once. $800k is too little of a penalty for dickbags advocating for this bullshit IMO.Not nearly severe enough. They should be sending the sheriff to lock the doors. Businesses that don't comply with the law don't deserve to exist.HAH. Good. Fuck those guys.I dont think their idiots. I think they just dont give a fuck.I personally don't own a diesel and I don't care if others do, but if you're removing emissions parts purely so you can shoot out some putrid black smoke, you are a tosser.I'm not sure on new trucks, but this whole deleting emission stuff boils down to reliability. The 6.0 known to be a piece of shit engine was actually a decent engine that was being fucked by emission systems. Last time I talked to a friend that likes diesel trucks, apparently emission systems still are the Achilles heel for most diesel trucks.

  


Rolling coal is fucking stupid for sure, but people dont delete emission stuff just because cause the government and their laws (ok some probably do) but others do it for reliability.[removed]I once lived in Fort Collins, Co. Land of polite Subaru outbacks and I would frequently see these trucks from Wyoming loudly tearing down our tiny downtown with black smoke billowing everywhere and I would think to myself, what a cunt.these guys sound like a couple of class-A dickwadsGood.Good. Anybody blowing smoke out their ass should get off the road..This is awesome! I hate it when I see someone blowing all that diesel out of their giant muffles because they think it’s cool. I wish there was a law banning that so cops could issue tickets when they witness it.Oh snap, I know one of these guys. He picked me up hitchhiking on the I-80. I had no idea who he was, but he gave me his business card at the end and told me if I ever need anymore help to call him.Every diesel owner I know gets this shit removed from their trucks.  No diesel owner likes using def.Here in Europe every diesel car that gets ecu boost blows black smoke like crazy. This fine is insane.Diesel Brothers? Are these Mad Max villains?That's more money than the entirety of the commercial airlines and shipping industry paid combined despite being the biggest polluters on earth

*Good job team! Saving the world 1 car at a time!*I mean thats what you get for not straight piping diesels and not even trying to hide itThe bigger crime is that awful show is still on the airDiesel brothers sounds like a number one hit show on the incest network.Hahahaha!!!!   Good!!!People who roll coal should be forced to breathe it.Wonder how fast it would charge on a 240v circuit, like they have as RV hookups at campgrounds....They said they were going for the work truck market, I guess they weren't kiddingLove the powerfrunk, LOL.That rear is amazing and that frunk is so impressive.

Honestly given the price this is a game changer. What an impressive way to bring back the Lightning nameplate.If this isn't a game changer I don't know what is.I was just reading MSRP predictions earlier today and all the news sites were saying $70k to start, six figures fully loaded.

Rolling in with a sub $40k entrance fee is pretty spectacular.I think this is the EV moment. This thing will sell like crazy.Impressive price, really really impressive.Mustang is never the most important vehicle for Ford. It is always the f150.Wtf I want an F150 nowThat Frunk tho!Hope they have a good source of batteries, that's going to be the only limit on this truck.IMO this vehicle is a paradigm shift. They are going to sell an absolute fuck ton, I wouldn’t be surprised if 10 years from now 50% of F-150’s sold are all electric, it’s that big of a deal.This would be great for most people who drive trucks.Yeah the electric car revolution is now really here. So many people that buy trucks in and around major cities and use it to commute and etc. will happily buy this at this price point and love not having to pay ton of money in gas each month.Shoutout to Linda Zhang the chief engineer. Her career is some proper American Dream stuff.Canadian pricing: MSRP starting at $68,000 up to around $110,000. Looks like Canada won't be getting the base model.Full hard on. I was under the impression that the price would be out of my range but a pleasant surprise starting under 40kHow is a fully electric f150 crew cab cheaper than a f150 crew cab gas. That’s insaneThat's not a terrible price and with the tax credit that's actually a damned good deal no matter the powertrain. 770lbft torque too.. my god.I can’t believe they even have this thing being able to power a house for 3 days. That is so crazy. Man. Ford knocked this out the park based on what they are bringing. I just bought a car like a year ago. But with how the EV market is blowing up I’m about ready to trade in by next year and go electricI wanna hate it.  I wanna be the guy who cries about them "ruining the Lightning name."  I really do.  But considering this is everything the Lightning was, only better, is hard to overlook.   The only thing missing is the soundtrack.Amazing. My dad called me after the reveal and said that we just saw his new truck. 

They are going to sell so many of these. Another plus for ford is that many universities and city governments have committed to all electric fleets, but sure as hell weren't going to buy a cybertruck. I imagine these are gonna become standard city trucks soon unless gm can pull it together pretty quick.I’m def interested. I have a 2018 truck that I’d def trade in for this. 90% of my driving is around town and even with towing 300 miles is acceptable.As someone who has been planning on buying an electric vehicle in the next year or two, and has always wanted a truck but never wanted to pay for the gas, this just sold me. 

Like this is cool as heck. I've never been a big Ford guy but this is fucking cool.I am a Tesla fan but WOW! I'm so impressed with Ford. This truck, especially at the price point, really blew me away.So basically Rivian has half a year of the market to itself between June this year and spring 2022 to grab as much mind share as possible before the big gun arrives. This is going to be a fantastic battle to watch.This is gonna catapult the EV shift! Amazing features at a very attractive entry price.[removed]Holy shit, 775-lb-ft at a price that, after federal incentives, *is the same as a nicely optioned Camry.*

**IN THE CHEAPO VERSION.**

While the range could be better and its V8 roar'll be missed, **THAT IS INSANE.**  Step aside, Elon... they get this right, there's a new EV king in town.Wow. That price is a big deal.Fuck me running, that's impressive. The lack of bed space and payload capacity is a bit disappointing but I wonder if I could live with that.

I'm seriously tempted.I loved the president’s [comments](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CPDwEN9hu08/?utm_medium=copy_link) on the truck. “This sucker’s quick” 😂Just wow! Huge huge play in the electric car game.[Fuck it, I'm in](https://i.imgur.com/kj3Chfk.jpg)Could probably finance one of these just with the fuel savings from not having a gas truck. I spend $300-$400 a month on gas for my V8 truck.Holy fuck that frunk is incredible.  The future of trucks is awesome and I am not a truck person.I'm very impressed. It isn't gimmicky like the Hummer or CT. They really seem to have thought out the electric part of the truck well and are playing up the electric specific benefits for normal use. They're not just positioning it as an ICE replacement.

I saw some comments saying it looks just like any old boring F150, but I consider that an advantage. It's a truck. For truck people. But now it's electric. It doesn't have to look super futuristic. That will only draw people that like Teslas and trigger the people that don't like Teslas.

And all of that is ignoring the very reasonable price point.

With the new Bronco, the Mach E and this, Ford is killing it in my opinion.Not to mention the utility van and utility trim and improved mach e. I can see fleets picking them up like hot cakes. 

Less expensive shop visits? No more expensive gas? Federal kick backs too?? No extra stuff to track the shit out of them?? This is a companies wet dream, bigger profits AND improved surveillance.Never owned a Ford.  Never owned a truck.  This, I want!Obviously, it’s going to have slower charging times and lack some features, but the fact that they’re offering any EV at a price that low is damn impressive considering the Hummer is over twice as much and the Rivian truck is $30K more just starting out. You’re still going to get a very usable truck for $40K though. That’s cheaper than or comparable to most other full size trucks with 4WD let alone some midsize trucks out there. It’s a good step forward to get people into that market. Still, I’m not jumping into that market just yet unless I’m forced to. I have nothing against EVs because I actually built one in college, but I like hearing noise when I step on the gas pedal too much, and I live in a rural area with one charging station. I’d be more inclined to buy an electric motorcycle like the Livewire to be honest if it wasn’t as much as a crossover SUV.Rivian in shamblesMeanwhile $130k in AustraliaChargers need to be universal and regulated by the government.[removed]The Cybertruck is now a full-on joke. This is for folks who need a "truck" truck. Rivian will be more for "truck as a car" folks. Cybertruck I guess has the troll market, but good luck. 

For a long time Tesla's only advantage has been first to market. They still have some charging advantages, and of course brand… but Tesla will soon be one of like 6 choices in each of their segment. I'm glad I don't own Tesla stock right now.

Props to Ford. 

Gimme a Bronco Lightning and you a non-Ford guy into a Ford customer.Hear me out... foldable truck bed covers that are solar panels.That truck may give Tesla a run for their money especially because it actually looks like a truck and the other highlights.I immediately made my reservation and then promptly cancelled my Cybertruck reservation.

Sorry Tesla, but Ford is beating you to the punch.I've never once been interested in pickup trucks but this price and this capability is going to literally change the car and truck world.  Mary Barra and Elon Musk are shitting their pants right now.[deleted]Hummer EV is dead charging almost 100k.They are gunning hard for the fleet & work truck market. Businesses including charging banks for their work vehicles may have a trickle effect to more employers and service based businesses including more charging stations for their customers. My biggest hesitation on swapping to an electric truck is, where the hell do I charge it away from home? I drive a Ram 1500, I’m open to the idea of an electric counterpart, but I’ve seen how few AND small the electric charging station spots are publicly around DFW. And I get it, the range is supposed to be kept in mind and I go home to charge, but that’s no guarantee. I can stop and get gas almost anywhere & anytime.It's cool but my biggest gripe is the range....the standard f150 can go 700 miles per fillup. Most people will start looking for juice around 160 mile mark in this thing. I'm also curious with how hauling will effect range in this. I guess we will see. I was really hoping for something closer to the 400 mark for rangeAs someone who owns a Nissan Leaf. Expect 100 mile range with a loaded bed going 80mph. 

We need a nationalized standardized charging network ASAP. Stop this Tesla and Rivian only allow their own kind to charge bullshitIt is eligible for 7.5k tax credit resulting in below 33k pricing.  This very impressive pricing and huge value for money. I would argue even the mid trim is also highly competitive and will be under 50k with tax credit.  Ford has done everything they could have practically done230 mi is plenty for me.  If I can actually get one for that price I absolutely will. (Depending on the job I hopefully get soon)If you live anywhere with reasonable amounts of sunshine, and install home solar panels, this truck can save you alot of money.

The solar panels can charge the truck, saving your electricity bill. 
When the truck is parked up, your house can use its battery to power appliances. Saves the electric bill again.

If you have two trucks for the household, then you might see your bill go to Almost zero. (Depending on how much Aircon you use. Aircon is crazy power hungry).

Normally the batteries you have to buy to do this cost Hella money and the playback is c. Ten years. Now you get the battery effectively free.

This could move a major portion of the US away from gas, and coal/gas power stations, and majorly cut emissions.

A car company helping the environment. Who would have thought it. 

If you've not checked it out, many states have generous tax rebates for solar. For a few thousand bucks, you could cut your electricity bill in half four every, maybe more.Tesla HQ must be sweating right now. The Cybertruck was going to be their big play for the pickup market and Ford just undercut them with a far more iconic model.230 isn't that impressive. It'll be even less while hauling somethingCybertruck who?An EV Truck for 33k built by a car company that can actually throw together an interior (sorry TSLA fans) is insanely impressive. This decade is going to be exciting; there is going to be some unreal competition between all the major car companies in this segment.I feel like Lightning would get off-road trim and even a Raptor formula, as the truck has waterproof design.That is seriously some of the best pricing on an electric vehicle I've seen so far.This is a great truck, great concept, etc.

HOWEVER: 230/300 mile range on a truck? I understand the weight and aerodynamics are going to make it less efficient and thus require more battery storage capacity. 

That makes sense. But it's a truck... They're big vehicles. Are you going to drive one up to the mountains and camp out for a night? Not unless there's a charger nearby. 

Are we going to use it to tow things? Again not unless there's a charger nearby at the destination. 

I love the concept of the frunk. But I think I'd rather that space be utilized to give this vehicle more range. 

I'm ready to move to electric, but the range and charging is an issue that hybrids have already solved.I love this, and I can’t wait for the inevitable performance version in a few years. 

My only gripe is that massive screen. They did something similar on the explorer and it just seems so lazy. Like the took an iPad and glued it to the dash.The house power thing is huuuuuuuge and a major plus for me.  How awesome would a new solar roof be with this as a backup?  You could have a blackout and never run out of power if you managed your usage properly.  No need to buy some expensive house backup system or generator.  I have been saying for years when someone does this with EVs it will really push them towards desirable to the average suburban home and now we have it.  This makes solar that much more viable as well.  I’m excited for it and can’t wait to see what the future holds. If the standard truck is 575 hp how cool would it be to have a 700hp raptor version in a few years?10,000 lbs targeted tow rating tooI’m more interested in the Intelligent Back up Power. Handy generator power without the mess of a loud gas-powered one in the middle of winter or hurricane season. 

Anyone know if this will come to the Mach E?[deleted]I’ve wanted an F150 for a long time but my commute and rare need for a truck (so many projects start with a load of: bricks, wood, mulch…) and abysmal mpg compare to my 10 yr old Prius made it challenging to spend $40k on any truck when a Tesla makes more sense with an EV + solar panels home setup.  Great job Ford.   Maybe a truck IS in my future.  I’d get the base model since the extras in upgrades seem unnecessary and comes standard with 4 wheel drive. Looking forward to putting lots of junk in my frunk.I mean, this is impressive and will sell well in certain markets. But for anyone I know who owns trucks, this definitely won't work with a 300 mile range max. Especially when towing is considered, which I assume will drop the range drastically. Even if towing only drops it to 200 miles, I know people who have cabins or places they stay that is further than that from their main homes. Or who take yearly roadtrips to Florida or Tennessee with their trucks (I live in Michigan). They take their trucks and trailers/toys/boats to the Upper Peninsula which is 200-500 miles depending on where you live in Michigan and where you are going in the UP. So people would need a 2nd truck which would go against the ideas of an eco truck for all around use.

Regardless, these are impressive numbers for a commercial truck. I am surprised they managed to get this range. There must be a lot of batteries. I also imagine by 2023 they will have a King Ranch or equivalent trim level with a slightly higher range? Maybe 350-400?I'm not saying I drive for four straight hours every day, but I do it often enough that a 230 mile range would not work for me.r/lordstownmotors is in shambles right now. Never seen so much dillusion how a $50k truck from a company that has never sold a single truck is going to overthrow Ford.If they can actually deliver a decently optioned EV F150 for around $40k...fuck, I'm inThis will sell like hotcakes *and* the cybertruck will too. Both can exist, the market is massive. Ford will happily take the fleet sales but the reality is 95% of pickups in this class sold don't actually *do* any work. Everyone compares the cybertruck to this saying oh this has so much better utility when the honest answer is the majority of buys aren't going to actually care about the utility.The inflated-ass housing market (especially in Canada) sucking up most of their paychecks is probably a big factorSell me a decent size home for 80k and ill buy a 40-50k sports car.It just show in the fact that there are more supercars models over $2million then sportscars models under $50k. In 2006 there was only one car over $1 million the Veyron and it was still $500k more expensive then the second most expensive car at the time.It's not just young people that can't afford them. If you have a family or need a commuter, but can only afford one car, you can't afford a cheap fun car.\*\*Tries to get a new coupe car in Europe\*\*

"May I interest you in this new lowest trim Subaru BRZ for 42 000$?"Young people don't even want them. Im in college and all my friends have or want SUVs. Go through any parking lot there and you don't see a bunch of economical sedans like you would expect at a state school, there is just a bunch of SUVs. I have a friend who is 5' 6" and got in my 2013 3 Series and complained about how small it is... Everyone now needs an SUV to carry more than 2 people and get groceries for their family of 3. 

I find driving to be something fun but I think most people, especially younger people, see their cars as appliances and driving as a chore. Of course there are still young people buying sports cars but most of the time they are buying used.That and everyone who does want a car wants a crossover/SUV, especially if you have 1+ kids.Trucks are even worse.  The used market is insane for them.Student loans are a factor too if you live the US. Insurance is also insanely high: about 1/3 my monthly payment.

Also, I wonder if traffic isn’t a factor. Roads that were lightly used in my area when I was I in high school are parking lots now. A V8 isn’t much fun if it’s just crawling through stop and go traffic at half the speed limit.One factor I don't see mentioned often is that modern cars are more reliable and last longer than ever. There are tons of cheap fun cars out there - they're just the expensive fun cars from 10 years ago.My Dad went to work right out of high school at a meat packing plant. At 22 he had two snowmobiles, a k5 Blazer as a winter beater, and paid in cash for a brand new 1984 Pontiac Fiero 2M4.

Here I am at 23 making < $30K with a civil engineering degree (pandemic killed lined up jobs), looking at $80k+ college debt.
 
Yeah, I'm in no place for another expense.This may be a little bit true but there is actually a lot of other things going on as well:

\#1 Cars in general are not as popular, people want and are buying SUV's.

\#2 Having a sports car use to seem cool. Go to the parking lot of a upper income school and you'll see very few sports cars.  

\#3 The kids in general don't want sports cars. Hell a lot of them don't even want to drive. When I was 16 I was at the DMV on day one and had the whole day planned out once I got my license. The few neighbor kids I've talked to don't really seem to care.

\#4 People are moving to cities. Cities, traffic, and sports cars make a sucky combo.

\#5 A lot of young people today are risk averse. 

\#6 Americans are getting even fatter. Most 20 year olds couldn't even fit in an S2000 let alone be comfortable. 

\#7 A plain jane 2020 Accord is probably as fast as the 89 Firebird Formula I had in high school. Why does a 25 y/o need/want a sports car. Modern cars are more sporty across the board. It's comical to think about the Cadillacs and Oldsmobiles my parents drove in the 80's 

\#8 Waiting longer to get married. It's was ok for me to have a 350z if my wife has an SUV that can do everything else.Price of cars has risen too much, and salaries didn't. 10-15 years ago you could have had a "fun" car for 20k euros, now cars START at that price. And I'm talking like Fiat 500s.That's why I have motorcycles. More speed, less money.

Don't get me wrong, I'd love an M2 or a Corvette. Having a car would make (the last 14) winters here in Seattle much easier. But being Seattle, I have to spend the money I'd drop on a fun car simply paying for my existence. My wife's Scion is the closest I'm gonna get anytime soon.We can't afford cheap non-fun cars either.Also, you need a garage to truly get into cars and that is even more unachievable for most young people.[deleted]And at lesst in some places,  insurance costs are unbearably high.

In the days before the Internet and cellphones, if you wanted to see your friends you needed transport.  Now, young people use tech to "see" (sometimes literally) their friends, so transport is less important.  Want to go racing?  Tech substitutes for cars again - its cheaper, safer and more convenient.Was this written in the 90s? Cheap muscle cars haven't been a thing since my parents were growing up in the 70s and 80s.They really need to come out with a base-line level trim if they expect people to buy zippy little new cars. Why does a car need to have a fancy infotainment when I already have a screen on my phone and just need a bluetooth connection to the radio? I don't need powered seats either and plastic is fine for everything as long as it doesn't rattle too bad. I already have lane departure assist; they're called eyes and my hatch doesn't need automatic closing. Why bother with a push button when a key does the job all the same and why would I need remote start either? They could literally strip off so many of the bells and whistles to cut the costs down to make cars in the range to where young people could afford to go out and buy them new.

If I want seat warmers, I'll just get taco bell and a tall hot coffee.Sounds like they aren't cheap then.When compact performance cars (i.e. Veloster N) are now almost $34,000, a higher price than the BMW 3 series was less than a decade ago, then you know something is seriously screwed up in the market. 

Cars have all moved $10,000 upmarket, and wages have not. Loans have just gotten longer and longer. Something's got to give, and I don't predict it to be a very fun event to live through.I think a lot of this has to do with people demanding their cars do everything. When my dad was younger he had a few fun cars, they were either 2 + 2s or small 2 seaters. He did not have an SUV or a truck, he just drove those and that was it.

Now people want their cars to do everything. They want a bed, or a 3rd row, or a massive SUV, and it has to have AWD and look like it could go offroading. It also needs to be comfortable, with apple carplay and android auto, etc.

If they get a "cheap fun car" it's in addition to a car that fits many or most of what I wrote above. I know a ton of people who purchased 20-40k cars shortly after college, most of which being CUVs/SUVs. That could have easily been a daily plus a relatively expensive fun car. But people want their cars to do everything at all times.

If I tell someone my only car is a 2 seater their response is not "oh nice what car" it's "how do you drive that in the snow without AWD! Or go to the grocery store without a truck/suv!" That alone tells the story to me, at least in my area.While I do agree that there are larger underlying economic factors here, consumer choice is part of the equation as well. There is both the issue of people having less purchasing power AND what they choose to do with it.

I have what I think would be one of the best examples of a "cheap fun car" sold in the US in the last 10 years. It did not sell that well and I couldn't replace it with a new model as Ford has decided to stop selling any cars not called the Mustang. If younger people want jellybean crossovers with CVTs I am not sure that giving them more purchasing power would help.[deleted]Why buy a new cheap car when buying TSLA calls today means I can buy a supercar next week?Yup. At youngest is wealthy dual-income late-30/early-40 somethings by and large.

Have an infant and a toddler? Then you're gonna want that SUV headroom.Not only house pricing but also insurance is ruining young enthusiasts chances of obtaining a fun carWhat a great and timely piece this is. Housing price inflation is a function in large degree of restrictive land use controls and exclusionary zoning. Developers would gladly build higher and denser housing at a price point far more affordable than a $350,000 single family house, but in a giant swath of the US, you'll get run out of town trying to build dense apartments. 

Too many dollars chasing too few houses in pretty much every metropolitan area in this country.*creates an economy so inflated that young people can’t afford simple things*

*suprised pikachu face*The most shocking thing about the Ted Bundy tapes was when one of his victims said she was working part time at a gas station and had just bought a new Camaro.No. It’s all about the insanely stupid price of college. That kid in the 90’s had no student debt. A kid in 2019 most likely has $100,000 or more. They cannot buy anything.I don't buy it. Cheap fun cars are dying because nobody wants them. People wants trucks and SUVs.

From 1990 to now, light truck sales have increased 6 times. F150 sales have increased from 495,977 to 896.526. Ram went from 87,978 to 633,694. Silverado from 464,668 to 575,603. Sierra is up to 232.323 (I don't have 1990 numbers)

In that same time the top F-150 MSRP went from $14,933 to $71,160.

In 1990, there were 773.4 cars per 1000 people. By 2016 it was up to 831.9 cars per 1000 people.

Currently, more people than ever have cars. And those cars are more expensive than ever. If they wanted sports cars, they could afford them.

Problem is now it can cost over a billion to design a car. In the 1990s, the cheap fun cars were based on, or shared parts with, the regular cars. Take the Fox Body Mustang for example, the platform was used by 17 cars. That's a lot cars to split the R&D across. Now Ford doesn't have any cars except the Mustang. So the next Mustang has to share a platform with an SUV -- that's not an ideal way to make a cheap, fun, car.

Other companies don't have platforms to share to make sports cars.

The other issue is that the performance of regular cars go too good. If a Camry can do 0-60 in 5.8s, what's the point of buying a sports car? A Miata or BRZ is slower. If you want better performance than a 'regular' car, you need to spend a shit ton of money.This is killing America not just the car enthusiasts. This is the downside of the "continuous growth" modelOver priced housing is one issue. But one that no one talks about is that all the fun cheap cars are usually priced out of reach because people hear how great said car is and everyone rushes to buy them up in mass for themselves or buy several to make racecars out of those platforms. 

I remember when you could get a near mint 240 sx for 5-8k, then the fast and furious, drift and jdm obsession kicked in. Now you can't get any fun, cheap Japanese cars, you have to spend 10k + for any of the cool shit. 

Mean while I can still get an F-body camaro and firebird/trans am for under 10k. May not be the best example, but I can get a pretty good runner for that.I mean, yeah. The girl in the photo probably bought that car new by selling lipstick at the mall

I'm an engineer with no student debt and I couldn't afford a new camaro unless I made huge life sacrificesWork 65 hours a week. Make $1200 net, $2400 a month. Renting a studio and driving an 18yo car with 230k mi. Bills come out to be $1900 a month. Yeah wonder why I can't afford nice thingsI'm 20 and a student I'll be buying a 90s civic lol, can barely afford food with college and other bills.

edit: grammerCorrection: cheap fun cars are dying because there are no more cheap carsNot even.  There are TONS of cheap fun cars available to young people (Any 90's or early 2000 Honda Civic/accord for example).  Another example, 2 months ago I found a 03 Lexus is300 on craigslist in amazing condition, all original with a manual transmission and less than 120k on it.  Those cars have a 2JZ engine and the seller was asking less than $10k for it....   What it comes down to is that a lot of young people want to drive a brand new car, don't want/don't know how to fix a used car and/or they're embarrassed to drive an older used car.  

After reading this article, it's not necessarily about a lack of cheap fun cars available to young people.  It's about a lack of cheap fun NEW cars available to young people.  The only young people I've known to have a New (or no more than 10 years old) car are the ones whos' parents bought the car and gave it to them. The only other young people I've known in my life who were able to afford a new car are those who sold drugs.

TL;DR: Being young and being able to have a cheap fun car isn't a matter of being an "automotive diehard" like this article says.  It's a matter of being realistic and smart rather than being materialistic.  Now if the article was properly titled (Cheap fun NEW cars are dying because young people can't afford them) I'd totally agree.Us youngings just want a fast Japanese car, reliable and simple. Yea bmws and Mercedes are cool but holy shit are they priced at a premium. Give me the gt 86 with 300 HP already!!!Cheap and fun cars aren't that cheap anymore.My parents got to have a lot more fun than me. They also got to have a much more typically middle class American life. I don't get any of that. I don't even get to have hope for a better future. Just mountains of debt, copious amounts of depression and anxiety, and big heaping helping of general malaise. Thanks mom and dad.I am pretty close to the oldest in my generation.  I am 35 and a millennial.

A lot of the younger folks coming up in my generation and those in college who are Gen Z bellow us don't realize that the hardest part about buying a house is coming up with the down payment.

There are programs, especially for first time home buyers that may help but I'm general, you need about 15-20% down payment ( of the purchase price )

Please correct me kindly if I am wrong on this one.

I am an electrician so I make okay money but 3 bedroom, 2bath basic homes in the suburbs of Phoenix are now nearing 275k to 300k. 

I can afford the $1200 to $1400 per month mortgage payment and property taxes.  I don't have 40 to 50k cash money laying around for a down payment. I already owned a home in my 20s so I don't qualify for any first time buyer programs.This is real shit. My dad has a classic Nova, so cars have been a major part of what the two of us bonded over as I was growing up. It was always my dream to get a project car with him and fix it up so we could go cruising together, but there's no way I could do it now. The cost is too great, and for a while half of my monthly income was going towards rent, even when getting a decent deal on rent from my parents. 

There's a local car show every year, and while you see all sorts of people come out to look, the people that own the actual cars get older and older every year.Don't forget that Cash for Clunkers did a great job of killing this segment. I know it was a while ago but it's going to take some time to replenish the market at cheaper prices, especially in these times. 

I live in the southwest. Good luck finding a beater 4x4 at a decent price.

Edit: spelling*Everyone stop saying big cities are unaffordable. I could buy [this 368 sq ft condo](https://www.redfin.com/CA/Los-Angeles/320-S-Ardmore-Ave-90020/unit-228/home/7089224) in an up-and-coming neighborhood in LA for only $255,000 plus $228/m in HOA dues. Checkmate, millennials!*

More seriously, this is one of those issues I've been reading about for years, and it's so much more complicated than, "Just stop buying coffee and avocado toast," or, "Kids these days just major in interpretive dance feminism and have the audacity to make $250,000/year right out of college!" But the more you look into all the issues that caused the bigger problems, the clearer it becomes that the real issue is an older generation pulling up the ladder behind them. 

Look at the cost of attending college. It's not just that it used to cost less. You also used to be able to earn enough to cover tuition working part-time. But college costs didn't magically go up on their own. Governments cut state education budgets, including funding for universities. Older voters just assumed if that ever caused any problems, they wouldn't be affected. 

Now that we're seeing the problems that caused, the people who supported for those policies aren't saying, "Wow, we really messed things up. Let's see what we can do to fix things. Maybe try some policies from the late 1960s that really benefited us?" 

No, we get told we shouldn't have listened to our parents telling us to go to college. We shouldn't have listened to our parents and teachers when they called student loans "good debt." And we definitely shouldn't blame them for getting it wrong because the real problem is a bunch of 17-year-olds. 

Housing is the same way. Older voters decided they didn't want property taxes to track with home value, so there are people with huge yards and multi-million-dollar houses paying less each year than I'd pay if I bought that tiny condo I linked to above. And in Manhattan, don't you dare suggest any changes that might ruin the character of a rich-people neighborhood. 

We're talking about one of the most populous cities in the world, located on a literal island. Every building on Manhattan should be like 10 stories or more. But no, the rich people living in their Sex and the City houses think they deserve to have it all, so screw everyone else. 

Then we get to jobs where guys like Jack Welch really messed things up. I still remember a guy going on a rant about how entitled young people were because they thought they deserved $40,000 right out of college. Back in his day, his first job only paid $15,000. Spoiled brats! 

(Oh, wait, $15k in 1980 would have been at least $40k when he said this. More like $48k now.)

Just look at what happened when the CEO of a credit card processing company no one had ever heard of decided to pay every employee at least $70,000. Older people lost their minds, calling is the mean S word, saying they hope his company fails. How dare a private company not worship at the altar of shareholder primacy? 

But you also don't have to be a genius to understand that people need to have money to buy things (OK, or credit). If wages stagnate while cost of living goes up, of course, people are going to stop buying your products. Cut the supply of spending money, and demand for your products and services go down.When every automotive journalist is encouraging people to buy a fully depreciated German sports car, yeah that'll happen.Young people can maybe afford the car but it’s the insurance that is expensiveI'm just not buying anything new.

2002 F250 diesel owned since 2008. Purchased with 90k, currently at 208k

2002 Nissan Xterra, owmed since 2017. Purchased with 185k, currently 218k

2001 GMC Sonoma, inherited in 2018. Received with 78k, currently at 90k

1985 Lincoln Town Car, purchased summer 2020. Purchased with 145k, currently 147k

1972 Ford F250. Purchased original project 2011, in its current form in 2016. Odo irrelevant, I've put near 10k on the truck since project completion in 2018.


For all I've spent on these 5 vehicles, I couldn't touch the price of a new F250 - even new in 2008. I also do all my own maintenance and have factored that cost in as well.3-4 year old used cars are the new cheap new cars for young people.It’s almost like lowering wages and making life incredibly expensive makes it harder for people to buy things...Then there’s that Honda gold“Millennials are killing the”

*shuffles deck, pulls card*

“Cheap Fun Card industry”Millennials literally aren’t buying new cameros at age 15 and it’s so f’n disgusting.Unpopular Opinion - Bring a Trailer is killing the cheap fun car scene due to rich people overpaying for traditionally cheap sports car, and everyone selling them are now using BaT prices as the new baseline.If wages kept up with inflation and changes in productivity we wouldn't be having this conversation.

But that would go against constant corporate profit growth so nu-uh not going to happen.If young people can't afford them, maybe they're not so cheap after allI’m just glad they went for the root cause instead of blaming young people.Realistically in 2020 most people have to choose between having a family and having nice toys. The vast majority of people cannot afford both unless they were born with a silver spoon in their mouth.Additionally, I think one of the issues for many (not just the young) is that, because cars are so expensive, they need a car that can do it all - which is why we see so many SUVs and trucks. The days of having an extra fun car are over for most."Cheap cars are dying because they are no longer cheap."But at the same time truck and SUV sales are through the roof? I just think people don’t want them anymoreI'm absolutely one of those people on the lower end of the economic spectrum for whom practicality won out over my interest in a more fun car- and all of my savings are towards an ever insane housing market. A fun car basically falls last in my list despite my interest in cars being so large i'm a sub to r/cars“Cheap fun cars”, yet the photo is a classic SS that costs upwards of 50k in good condition.

lol okay, Road & Track.Between student loans, job insecurity and low wages, young people generally have less disposable income nowadays and when the money starts to flow in, they're usually already out of their "Let's buy a nice car and have some fun" phase and prefer to buy a house or start a family ...has anyone considered that maybe, just maybe, people stopped giving a shit about cars.

i say this as someone who spends too much money on a monthly payment and i love my carHoly, what a reaction. Glad to see people reading my first piece in the automotive press!!! Couldn't be happier. 

Happy wrenching, fam. <3This take is utterly terrible, especially for a respected publication like Road and Track.

&#x200B;

Completely irresponsible for a respected magazine like Road and Track to not even fact check the graph the Author himself linked. For instance, the author claimed that average house prices have gone up from $79,100 in 1990 to  $325,000 today. [While linking this graph as a source.](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSPUS)

&#x200B;

Except if you can read the graph, in Q1 1990 the median house price is $123,900......

&#x200B;

Edit: 

Ok, so let's dig into the numbers shall we? The author claims that cheap sports cars are dead because young people cannot afford them, and that enthusiast vehicles are disappearing. 

&#x200B;

Let's look at expensive sports cars for a minute shall we? 

&#x200B;

Let's start by examining the numbers of the Cadillac Allante. The uber expensive flagship Cadillac sports car that was the butt of all the jokes for being a huge flop in the 80s and 90s. Over 7 model years, Cadillac sold a total of 21,430 of them in the United States. 

&#x200B;

The Lexus LC sold 5,682 in its first three model years. If we assume a constant average number of sales, you're looking at an extrapolated 13,258 sales over 7 years. Jaguar's F-type, by all means a sales success, barely exceeded the Cadillac at 23,715 over 7 years. Audi's TT? over the last 7 years it sold 12,329. Hell, Acura NSX sales are down significantly, the new NSX cannot even crack 300 units last year. 

&#x200B;

So the flop that was the butt of all the jokes back then actually would be considered a sales success by modern standards. Expensive sports car sales are pitiful. If the author's thesis is that cheap sports cars are dead because young people cannot afford them, then why did the expensive sports car market also implode? 

&#x200B;

Now let's look at the other side of the market. The author claims that "enthusiast car sales" are down, be he's blatantly wrong. Jeep Wrangler's sales numbers peaked in 2018, at 240,032. In 1990, Jeep sold less than 50 thousand of them. Toyota 4 runner sales also peaked in 2018, at 139,694 units. When it came out in 1994, Toyota sold 74 thousand of them. 

&#x200B;

Sports cars in general are a shrinking segment. Even the expensive ones appealing to rich people (note: arguably you can even say that expensive sports cars should do better due to income inequality) are doing terrible. 

&#x200B;

While on the other hand, Jeep Wranglers, 4 runners, Defenders, and all the off-road enthusiast cars are selling great. 

&#x200B;

Remember, up until this weird 2020, the car market as a whole has been very strong. Sales have been at or near all time high levels for many years in a row now, and average sale prices have only been going up. 

&#x200B;

In a time when overall car sales are strong and offroader sales are also strong, I hesitate to blame terrible sports car sales on the fact that young people aren't flush with cash. After all, expensive sports cars sales are also really, really down. 

&#x200B;

Maybe the easiest way to look at it is just that tastes have changed, and that despite the fact that the car market is extremely strong, people just don't want coupes anymore. 

&#x200B;

PS: want another data point? Last year, GLS class sold nearly double what the S class sold, and the S coupe/convertible sold so bad, they got axed for this year.  The S class obviously appeals to very financially secure buyers. Even wealthy buyers who likely own multiple cars don't care for coupes anymore.How on earth are they neglecting student loans? They are at least as big, if not an even bigger contributor to the issue as home prices.

If you don't go to college, you're going to have a hard time securing a high enough income to buy ANY vehicle new, even the cheapest of econoboxes.

But if you DO go to college, you may get a high enough paycheck to consider a fun car...but instead you're strapped to, on average 5-10 years of $500-$1000 monthly student loan payments. That directly comes out of leisure and transportation budgets.

Student loans are crippling this market far more than home prices, because your fun family free years are entirely spent digging yourself out of a massive hole of debt...if you ever escape that debt at all!

By the time millennials are in a place to buy any kind of new car, they'll have a fiance itching to start a family and buy a home...and another potential enthusiast bites the dust...and more compact SUVs depressingly fly off the lot.Kids graduating with over 80k in student loan debt, getting a job that barely pays 40k if their lucky. 40k back in 1970 is over 150k by today's standards.

Boomers took advantage and they did throw away the key and closed the door behind them. Only so many got in.
Don't expect the government to help you. Help yourself, no one else can or will the way you can. Don't wait for any help, help yourself.  The sooner you can come to terms that no help is coming... Only then will you begin to take care of yourself> Americans in this (25-34 age group) are in the prime of their youth, a time when a lack of responsibilities would historically pair with an influx of real adult income. It’s a precious window, a time when many would splurge on a brand-new sports car before children or other practical commitments got in the way.

That’s why I have two cars that aren’t crossovers. What in the world do I, a single 24yo, need a crossover for?! I can always compromise later. The time to own fun cars is either now or in my middle ages.

The only crossover my parents owned when I was growing up was a Lexus RX in the 2000s in the snowy midwest. Now they both each have their own crossover. Trying to convince my Dad to get a manual Miata/Mustang now that he’s retired (why on earth does he need a compact AWD CUV in the sunny southern USA besides ride height?)If they can't afford them then are they actually cheap cars?Yep. I'm 28, took me that long to afford what I wanted. Cost of insurance is also outrageous on anything fun.If you see an expensive car on the road it's probably paid by an HELOC on a house bought in the eighties.I feel like these days, a cheap fun car is an oxymoron. What can you find? A Honda hot hatchback?There’s nothing cheap about a $32k BRZ or Miata. 32k plus taxes and fees easily becomes 36k.Honda Fit died because American Honda gave up on it.[removed]Doesn't that mean that the car isn't cheap if people can't afford it?If people can’t afford them then they aren’t cheapNo, really?I'm 24 and have been looking for a decent 370z that makes sense to me financially. Just got a decent paying job and it took me months of checking FB marketplace, CarGurus, and Autotrader before I found something in my price range (10-14k max). Even finding a non-shitty mustang was chore. By some miracle a local dealer had a 2010 370z for 13k with 71 k miles. People list shitty Z's or Mustang's with 150 k miles for 16 k....Old cars, like new cars, get older every year and require more upkeep as they age. This means that every year there will be fewer old cars available in the market, driving up the value. This isn't an all encompassing rationale but the"back in my day, a burger was a nickle!" article is also not fairYup, the reason I got into motorcycles. Fun affordable trackable that I can do while owning a house.COVID has really sucked the fun out of my life, but *at least* I have it to thanks for slowing the endless 'millenials are killing X' stories. To think! Mainstream media acknowledging economic realities! It didn't even *use* the word millenial in it! I am truly a little surprised. 

The article even directly states that wages must rise. To think Road&Track would honestly advocate for wealth redistribution. What a wild ride 2020 has been.Meh. Cheap fun cars are dying because nobody buys them. What's ratio of Focus and Fiesta ST sales to F150 sales?

Consumers want everything, but it still to be cheap.  "I want a mid-size vehicle with great performance. It also has to have leather seats, nice interior materials (hard plastics!?! NO), climate control, neat infotainment features, and great reliability. Oh yeah, and it needs to be cheap..."400hp, $40k, and available in manual? This might be the one.This makes the 4 cylinder GR Supra price look bad.And because it's Nissan, you can get a no money down $400/120mo loan with a 400 credit score too.That blue color is money. I didn't think i'd love the new Z this much.... It's pretty close to perfect for me.It will sell for over 50k after dealers are done stuffing every add-on they can into it. You're not going to find a base model.Something tells me this won’t sell for $40k…And a 500% dealer markupI really hope we can all put our money where our mouths are, because 400hp for around $40k is a total steal. Definitely gonna be on my list in a year or two!Hopefully dealers don't mark it up to some stupid level of over sticker MSRP and cause actual buyers to go for something else.If you're looking to get even *more* erect.... the curb weight is rumored to be 3,252 lbsSeems like a good deal, although the base model is probably going to be pretty sparse. I can imagine the higher trims are going to be a lot more $, to include better suspension, bigger rims and tires, and more options.Nissan z was nowhere on my radar. But a 400hp little coupe with a 6 speed around 50k (lets be real im going for some options). Im definitely going to look into it now.This will perform so much better when I bolt a huge spoiler on the trunk.Going back to the true Fairlady bodystyle, I love itGiven how expensive cars have become this does not seem bad at all. Although I have a feeling none will be like this on dealer lots due to options.I hope they bring back the Brickyard color 
I loved that color on my 350zIm more concerned about the motor. Since its competition is the b58.Guys it says "around $40K" not "$40K" my guess is the most basic one will be around $42,990 and anything with even remotely any features will be around $47-52,000 which is in line with the Supra. Then reality - Nissan dealers are going to mark this up just like the Supra and charge $20-25K over sticker for any initial year model because one - Nissan dealers are scum of the scumdealers, and two - Nissan dealers have been looking for "profitability" out of a vehicle for years.   


I hope to god anyone in the enthusiast community learned a lesson from overspending on the A90 Supra and got screwed by the A91 Supra. Because I imagine year two of the 400z will be the Nismo version, and will cost less than anyone who paid a $20K premium markup for a base model year one.   


This car will be STUPIDLY priced, $65-75K guaranteed at launch. Those drinking koolaid thinking they will find one for $40K are delusional.The big news here is that the 9 speed auto shared with Mercedes will be used. That’s a much better trans than the 7 speed. I was surprised how good it felt in the Titan, I would imagine a reprogramming for the Z would feel amazing. Manual master race though.Easily gonna be hard to find, you'll be lucky to get a used one for $40k.Will be nice to see this go head-to-head with the new M2.

240z vs. 2002 pt. 2BREAKING: Nissan Z confirmed for Australia with 380 - hp, $80k price tag and stripped of options.

Insert something about our fuel not being good enough.Can I get a 150z please. I could afford that.40k hahaha yea right. They said the same
About the corvette. Priced under 70k. There are base corvettes well over 100k down here in s flaTime to start making 300ZX badges for the purists!Let’s fucking GO Nissan[deleted]Press release: https://usa.nissannews.com/en-US/releases/2023-nissan-z-press-kit


Lots of good info. This caught my eye though...I thought it would be significantly faster than the 370Z: "With an increase of 68 horsepower and a 30 percent increase in torque, the engine is designed to deliver a sharp, yet smooth response to the driver’s input, along with an estimated 15 percent improvement in 0 to 60 mph acceleration."


The 370Z, if I recall, gets to 60 in about 5 seconds. 15% improvement would put the Z at mid to low 4s.I'm so happy they kept the 😬 grilleWell… my midlife crisis car choice just got a bit more complicatedI've watched a few videos on this new Z, but they all said the price wasn't decided yet, so I'd be hesitant to believe that $40k price unless Nissan officially says it.

Either way, I absolutely love the looks of this car.  They absolutely nailed it.$40k... so lucky. In the Netherlands this would definitely be in the €100.000-€120.000 range due to taxes.

But it will probably not be available.And a minimum 10k - 15k “market adjustment” for the 15 idiots willing to pay, and 90% of dealers will sit on aging stock insisting on no test drives and no discounts as it’s a “special” car in “high demand” and “faster than a GTR” or some crap like that. Then Nissan will pull the plug due to “lack of market Interest” and it’ll be dead foreverI'm just here to laugh at the comments: whY wOUlD I bUY a bRz/Gr86 wHe tHE z Is goING To bE $35k?I knew $35k was a pipe dream but $40k is still quite reasonable. Excited to see the full reveal here shortly.This is probably the real reason why the WRX launch got delayed, TBH. $40k~ USD for a 400hp 6MT coupe is just nuts.I know everyone wanted the number to be sub-40, but it just could never be there. You're COO, you have a new sports car (introduced during a pandemic, which is causing semiconductor and other material shortages), you are staring down the barrel of some serious inflationary pressure and you're asked to put a price tag out there 6 to 9 months in the future. 

If all those problems go away, you're a hero with healthy margins, if they don't go away, well at least you didn't lose your shorts, or worse, lie to your fanbase.That’s $100 per Z. Good deal.Did they figure out how to make timing chains that don't stretch after 30,000 miles and tension glides that don't break around 35,000?I'm totally gonna get one in 10 yearsIt's too expensive! It's not powerful enough! Its doesn't come in brown! It's not used! It doesn't have enough seats! It's too yellow! It needs a bigger screen! It needs a smaller screen! It's not a real "driver's car"! 
I won't be buying this![Spring 2022 - has another announcement when this car comes to market less not forget](https://twitter.com/i/status/1426033542656524294)So do they have any other color besides yellow? I assume they do but this is the only color I’ve seen from the advertisementsLooks decent!Hot take but I think 40K+ for a manual Nissan even at 400HP isn’t going to be selling as well as r/cars thinks it willThis sounds great! A blow to the 4 cyl supra too.

Now, if you motherfuckers don't buy this car, especially in manual, then you lot have no rights to complain why nobody is buying manual (coupe) cars anymore.The dash/gauges looks like a Winamp skin from 2003...Still sad about EU not getting this...+ the 10k dealer mark upI can already hear a 17-year-old max revving this thing to 25 MPH outside my apartment at 3 AMManual transmission? Take my wallet. Right on!Can’t wait to hear the trombone aftermarket exhaust mods.Twin turbo v6 with 400 for 40k is pretty good. 

The rear looks amazing and a good homage to the original, but the front looks a bit meh, wish it was a bit sleeker.

Was looking for a fun car since I just drive a Camry.  The fact it comes in manual too makes it all the more appealing.  Sadly I doubt I’ll get one under 50k with all the mark ups the dealers around me do.Not typically comparable, but Im trying to decide between this and the CT4-V BlackwingMan. I drooled over the 350z as a kid. I could now comfortably afford this and would love to get one to drive my son around and wow him with my first cool sports car. But this thing just looks so.. Weird. It looks like a derpy robot face.RIP to the people who thought a $35k 400hp Z was happening.Yes but you have to go to a Nissan dealership to buy one.I just love seeing the comments full circle with the this is beautiful comments, this is ugly comments, the mustang is better comments, and it looks like a mustang comments. not to mention the camaro commentsPeugeot-Citroen-Renault-Opel-FIAT were already collaborating on several vehicles before the mergers; you could see the exact same car with 3 or 4 different badges. Now, they all come under the same umbrella.

- Fiat Scudo/Renault Traffic/Opel Vivaro/Citroen Jumpy/Peugeot Expert
- Fiat Ducato/Citroen Jumper/Peugeot Boxer
- Fiat Fiorino/Citroen Nemo/Peugeot Bipper
- Fiat Doblo/Opel ComboThis sounds like a direct quote from Jeremy Clarkson.Fiat used to be great, and I hope they stop being shit now. PSA has been doing really great lately, I hope they can manage to keep the brands (Peugeot, Citroen, Opel, Fiat) unique and worth getting excited over.I just want a Peugeot 508 with FCA's 2.0L turbo. A poor man's Giulia.I had a Peugeot 207. 0 problems with it, very comfy car, slow to get going but it ran on fumes which was great. Crashed it into telephone pole and emerged without a scratch.Why's the whole cat industry playing a game of who can make the biggest Leyland?Poo poo platterThe fact that both conversation street and top gear news is gone is just depressing. I can imagine Jeremy and James going on about this one.Are they calling the new company Fiascot?Dear mods,

can we please get a rule to only use the actual title of the linked article?Gotta be honest here, while Fiat has gone down the shitter in terms of the cars they are producing, Peugeot has been having a pretty good time recently. 

They have some nice looking, affordable and reliable motors as of late and the 208 GTI was a terrific return to form for a company which gifted us with the 105 and 205 GTI's.Finally. A union to rival Leyland.Look these cars are all on the “Cheap” side of manufacturing. It makes sense to combine all the best of each brand. Fiat have the Multi-Jet Diesel engine which is probably one of the best on the market, Peugeot has one of the best interior and exterior designs out there. 
I would hope they could bring it all together. Let’s not forget they can also tap into the bigger engine designs from the states being Chrysler.Unreliable?

2.0 HDI, 1.4 Multiair or 1.3 Multijet are ganging up on you.FiageotPeugeot’s aren’t unreliable. They’re cheap comfy cars. I’ve had no trouble with the petrols. They made unreal Diesel engines till they partnered with ford and made the 1.4 and 1.6hdi. Utter shite lol.Damn I just finished my multihour Wikipedia automotive platform rabbit holeOP is an idiot.Tbh I drive a fiat 500 myself. It's been a great car to run, drive and own in genral. Its undermined because of the standard consumer. As a 6'4" male this car fits me surprisingly well when many other cars are a struggling I have never had any issues with it despite being the 3rd owner. It's had regular servicing for its 11 year lifespan and is still a pleasure to drive.Hi there.

However, since there has already been robust discussion in this post, we're going to leave this up.

Thanks all.Looks like Fiat is about to ruin peugeots brandPeugeot is a really nice brand, I have a 1.6L diesel 207.

They are buying really shity brands like Opel and now fiat.

Stupid decisions.https://europe.jdpower.com/press-releases/2019-uk-vehicle-dependability-study
Based on uk consumers in 2019 Peugeout is the most reliable car brand.
Stop making false statements based on some simple asumptions that your chad bmw friend told youAs an owner of multiple Peugeots, I can tell you that they are almost as reliable as Toyotas, so stop talking bullshit.Fix It Again Pierre!The title lmaooOpposite of Toyota and Hondaall they need now is Renault  in the merger and they could call the new company CRAP  Chrysler/Fiat, Renault , PeugeotLmao that title is great bravo!Are we gonna start Peugeot cars rebranded as Chrysler and sold in America or something[deleted]Trick is having a Peugeot which is actually a ToyotaDoes this mean Saturn will return back to the states but in the form of an Opel???“In the short term, the combined group will use profits from selling Ram pickup trucks and Jeep SUVs to U.S. drivers to fund the development of cleaner vehicles to sell in Europe and China.”

Ahah, the illusion of ethical capitalism at its purest.Off topic, but imagine Toyota and Honda merge together. Largest reliable brand.This one I had to replace the entire clutch pipe work from master cylinder to slave, luckily the slave was outside the gearbox unlike the later ones. The 1.6hdi dw6 engine was also riddled with problems with the carbon build up and oil starvation to the turbos. Fords shared the same engine, plenty Focus’s I saw with the same issue.Might be a one off, perhaps. But my 2010 Fiat 500 is solid as hell.Is this an Onion article or is this a reality?Shit turbos on Opel comboMaybe it is like math.. you add two negative numbers and it becomes oh wait.Well actually Jaguar Land Rover is the most unreliable car maker in the world. Trust me, I know it wellCombining the French Death Wagon with the Italian Paddock Basher!This reminds me of the endless mergers that resulted in American Motors. When's Renault gonna take over and ruin everything?Fucking great title.
You couldn’t have said it betterFiat Chrysler is in the losing end of this deal. Look at the charts from the article. FCA makes more cars and earns more revenue using fewer financial resources and fewer employees. At first glance, Peugeot seems to be a weaker company.Considering Fiat also owns Chrysler, which is the worst American automaker. Its just a huge company of garbage.The fact that Mods are leaving this post is why i am unsubbing. You have to be kidding me. So clearly against the rules.Your changing of the linked article's title is unbelievably childish and ignorant.Imagine. Citroen Cactus mixed with a 500xl add in the woeful Vectra B chassis. That is true terror.Meh bring the 308 GTi over to the states. Keep the rest.Equivalent to a merger between Sonic and Checkers.Fca badSo it'll be peugeot, ~~Renault~~, Opel, Citroen, fiat, Alfa romeo, lancia, Chrysler, dodge, jeep, ram, ds, and vauxhall, with partnerships with dongfeng, BMW, and Toyota.

Can we start a death pool for which brands die first?

Edit: how the hell am I being upvoted for saying Renault is owned by PSA? That's what happens when I comment before the caffeine kicks inOP editorialized title is hugely misleading; Renault and Nissan **are not** part of this deal.

Also:

>	PARIS/MILAN (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot maker PSA have struck a binding deal to create the world’s fourth biggest carmaker, and now face the challenge of winning over regulators and delivering on a pledge to **slash costs without closing factories.**

Yeah, good luck with that...

>	Both tasks are likely to prove difficult, as two of the industry’s oldest dynasties try to combine Europe’s second and third biggest car manufacturers under the gaze of politicians and trade unions who have vowed to resist any move to cut jobs.

Like I said, good luck;  these are not automakers but employment programs for overpriced factory workers, unoriginal car designers and subpars engineering.You guys take yourself very seriously on here. 

There’s a reason French cars have a reputation for being unreliable. 

Just because your experience has been fantastic doesn’t mean anything...Disappointing in OP for inputting their own biases and narrative into the title. Give us the facts, the real title, and then the community will judge the content. All this thread has become is a battle between people who think Peugeots are reliable or not reliable and not about the actual story of two companies merging to create the third largest car company in the world.Many analysts are claiming that this is not a merger, if you go beyond the official statements, PSA is simply buying FCA.Inb4 comments about how peugeot and Fiat aren't unreliableBut I thought “the market” naturally, biologically, and instinctively sorts itself out?[deleted]The 206 sold fantastically. So many choices of engine and trim. Sold mine for a 207 gthdi for fuel economy as I already had my gti-6 for a bit of cheap fun. The 207 caused me so many headaches I then moved onto a much newer VAG diesel then.

The 306 sold incredibly too, think the design holds up even now. Have my Gti-6 garaged over winter as does a friend of mine.I thought this was a bald.tire post for a second.When is Peugeot coming to the USI am eager to see if PSA will use the Giorgio platform which underpins the Giulia and Stelvio. Would be a shame if the only cars with that platform would be the Giulia and Stelvio.Lol, at least it isn't Renault and Fiat.Any guesses as to what the new company name's acronym will be?

&#x200B;

FCA + PSA = FaP?srt 206 hellcat?Peugeot has been collaborating on engines with Toyota in the past few years, anything petrol from them that is recent 2010+ is pretty much rock solid and barely uses any gas. The 1.2 Puretech engine won engine of the year award 3 years in a row. 



The diesels are truly black magic in terms of fuel economy, i had a 2018 E220d with the new magic 2.0L diesel from Mercedes that is said to be the future of diesels, coupled with a 9G speed transmission and the best i got was 63mpg.  I was driving a company car, Peugeot 2008 1.6 Bluehdi for a trip, driving on company fuel so i did not care about fuel economy and when i get to my destination, look down and i had 67mpg. This is a engine used in every Peugeot and it has been in production for many years.

Aside from VW, Peugeot is the 2nd largest manufacturer of diesel cars, the one downside is the power, these things are not meant for performance, so don't expect BiTDi performance.I have 4th Citroen car after BX two Xantias now it's C4 next will be C4 Picasso or Cactus. Good reliable cars at work in tiles sales I used Fiat Doblo, two types of Berlingo/Partner and one Jumpy also good reliable cars and we banged them with forklifts dropping cargo like mad. Skoda's I used at my next job broke often (Octavia, Rapid and that small combi one) but they where hand me downs from upper management or national sales team so when we in international division got them they had well over 200k km with Octavia closing on 400k - getting stranded in Romania wasn't fun but then parts and mechanics knowing VW cars are everywhere so nothing bad happened.Fix It Again Tony. 

That said, I owned a Fiat 128 and LOVED it.Ouch.This is going to create a MASSIVE car company, with models that compete with each other......

Could call it EuroGMLOL!YikesThat's very original.....Actually fiat with their 1.4 petrol still has injection to intake manifold rather than direct. I make 50 000kilometres a year on that engine for last 8 years without any single mechanical failure.Peugeot makes some dope pepper grinders.0 + 0 = 0Only if Fiat could drop Chrysler.Forgive me if this is a stupid question but isn’t Opel part of GM? Or were they sold off at some point?Thanks I appreciate thatthere is a surprising amount of salt in this thread.Amen.  Includes Nissan (Versa is a Renault reworked)Opel is pretty good.ManiacsEnthusiasts: We want your bullshit.

Fiat Chrysler: Oh boy have we got bullshit for you. 

Enthusiasts: We're just going to post the same Supra/BMW bullshit and never actually buy anything.Arent they all under VW?Avcocato :(“Unreliable”

I hate manufacturers that signed the 250 agreementHow/where does Chrysler fit into this?If Opel still has a decent rear wheel drive chassis Chrysler/Dodge still has a chance to live.Now they can be...FCJD-LMNOP-RV-A US LLC?Does this mean I might get to see Peugeot in Canada?Upvote for the post title aloneFrench cars are trash.I have a feeling this deal will breakdownNice backhandThat title killed me.My family has a Peugeot and holy shit does it have so many problems. The entire dashboard would light up like a Christmas the sometimes and all the driving assistant will just shutoff. When you start the car just beeps with errors for about 2 minutes.

Alot of times it's this group of errors
-engine fault
-esc fault
-abs fault
-traction control fault
-radar (or whatever the automatic brake system is called) fault
And some other faultsThe terrible trifecta of totally trashy transmissionsI like shitty old Volvo's where do I fit in to this un-reliable shit showLol this title is the best part#winningI can’t wait for the new 2021 Jeep (Fiat) Peu Peu! It’s a cheap thing, you wouldn’t understand!Fia-geotI can't believe they left out Trabant and Yugo.The synergy of this merger will make Yugo look like Toyota.My Fiat 500e is awesome. 2015, no gas no oil, no maintenance at all and fast. I took the back seats out and made it hatch backI hope they plan to use vintage Lucas electrical bits and bobs.They just need to get any of the british brands to seal the deal on most unreliable car brand group ever.Probably a shot in the dark, but I would love to see Peugeots in North America. Especially the sleek looking 508.VW group is the largest unreliable car maker.But actually their engines are used by a signifcant  number of german auto manufacturers.Beginning of the end for these companies unless they can ditch ICE, particularly diesel, powered cars. EV vans are going to be hugely popular.  Generic skateboard design might open up the opportunity for smaller scale makers to emerge and fill niche positions.Just need Renault now and they can become F-CRAPLithium fires are a bitch to put out.  We have been using Lithium Polymer batteries in RC Airplanes and well anything RC for decade or so now.  The mainly erupt in crashes also but quite a few people over the years have burned their homes down simply charging them when they have unknown damage or internal fault.A number of racetracks have banned Tesla's racing, due to the fact that they don't know how to efficiently put the fires out or keep them out. They're not sure what hazardous materials come out of the car during the fire and will  contaminate the track and the surrounding area.At what point do they just prop up a pool so they don’t waste so much waterThere's [a good post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfDrivingCars/comments/mtda3p/no_one_was_driving_the_car_2_men_dead_after_fiery/guz52mw/) over in /r/SelfDrivingCars (that I can understand about 85% of) that explains why "dumping a shitload of water on it" is about the best procedure they have in these situations.If I remember, the Rimac 1 that Richard Hammond crashed kept flaring back up for 5 days after it crashed.Until cars have no steering wheel or pedals then you need to be in the drivers seat and ready to intervene at any timeI love all the posts telling the firefighters they are fighting a fire wrong. You guys know you can look up what Tesla itself says to do about a fire in one of their cars?I bet there won't be any strong opinions about this whatsoeverAaaaaand /r/teslamotors has changed a rule to ban certain crash related posts LMAOWhy does this article not list the model in the crash?  I'm curious about which battery tech this wasobviously, the morons who LITERALLY vacated the drivers seat for this stunt have the lions share of the blame.

but from a safety point of view, Tesla has done the absolute barest minimum job of detecting driver engagement.  Everyone else has adopted cameras for this task, while tesla continues to rely on torque sensing that is easily duped.  Its either incompetence, or its willful to facilitate owners to circumvent the controls.

I dont particularly care if tesla owners kill themselves, but these are public roads, and such unsafe vehicles should not be permitted to travel on the same streets as the rest of us.> Authorities will perform autopsies on both men.

I'ma go out on a limb here and guess that a car crash and fire killed them.Tesla should have never been allowed to use the term "autopilot". 99% of people blindly assume it's a self driving car just bc of that misleading marketing term, the subreddit "whatcarshouldIbuy" proves that.[deleted]Here’s Tesla’s emergency guide.  Includes how to put out battery fire - to use 3,000 of water and have a backup ready. https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/downloads/2016_Model_S_Emergency_Response_Guide_en.pdfShouldn't they have used some form of foam for a battery fire?We're all beta testers for Tesla's autopilot system, like it or not. As long as people have teslas on the road and tesla tells their customers it's called autopilot, everyone is part of the beta test./r/teslamotors is currently jerking off about Elon's tweet regarding "autopilot being safer" while this news article is sitting at 0 upvotes and a dozen comments....typicalTHATS ENOUGH WATER FOR 1730 AVOCADOS!!! WTF ELON?!/r/cars creaming themselves right now lol.That poor, poor, water.OK this will get lost or down voted but.  


On that section of road (no centre lane marking) you cannot enable autopilot.  


Without a driver in the driving seat the car will instantly flash warnings and slow down to a stop. They would have had to physically work round the safety systems of the car to do this.  


So most of this story sounds very fishy,[deleted]Wow, that's ridiculous. We don't have a way around using that much water for one vehicle? Sounds like an issue to me.Darwin wins againSo were these dudes sitting in the back drinking cocktails or what?It's simply amazing how many people will defend a "technology" to the end. Lots of folks are saying, you can't determine the cause of the crash till the Tesla's data is in. It is this denial and stubbornness, coupled with man's arrogance, that's going to be the end of us.


You can't design enough safety controls to circumvent stupidity. It's as if you abuse a tool, bypass all the safety features and ignore all the warnings, it can seriously hurt or kill you.

A corvette driver goes 100 mph on a public road and crashes... stupid driver.

An F150 driver drives home drunk from a bar and crashes... stupid driver.

A Kia owner crashes while texting... stupid driver.

A Tesla owner rigs their car up to bypass all the safety features of AutoPilot, ignores the warning about paying attention while keeping both hands on the wheels, ignores the warning to hold the steering wheel, unbuckles their seatbelt while the vehicle is moving and climbs into the back seat, and the car crashes... OmG sOmEtHiNg NeEdS tO bE dOnE aBoUt TeSlA. wE nEeD mOaR rEgUlAtIoNs!!!Autopilot not engaged. 

https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/19/elon-musk-autopilot-not-used-in-texas-tesla-crash.htmlI don't understand how that would be possible. You can't engage autopilot on the road they crashed on, and autopilot wouldn't engage with somebody in the driver's seat. Even if they could have somehow tricked the car into going into autopilot, it would have been limited to 30mph on a local road. Even if you could get it to engage autopilot for a moment, autopilot asks you to hold the wheel more aggressively based on how confident it is in what it sees, and there's no way he would have had the time to get out of his seatbelt (which also disables autopilot) before it would have instructed him to take over and started slowing down. 

Obviously we don't have all the details here, but I'm really skeptical. Only possible explanation I can see her would be if they put it in cruise control and maxed out the speed, which isn't dependent on the road, but even then I believe it would have freaked out when they attempted to leave their seat.[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1384254194975010826](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1384254194975010826)TIL: Even stupid people buy Teslas.There's over 16,000 accidents per day in the U.S. this is just one of them. A really unfortunate situation. 

But, This is not some sort of reason why EVs suck, and we should take this as a serious warning to always be paying attention to the road regardless of auto pilot or manual driving. 

I own a Tesla Model 3, and I use autopilot daily, but I'm always focused on the road, watching my speed, and prepared to retake manual control. This is how it should be done.Not sure how this occurred? The other day I was backing up in my driveway. I unbuckled my seatbelt so that I could lift up to take my wallet out my back pocket and lights and beeps went off and car stopped on it’s own.#1... Come on dumbass, you're still supposed to to be driving.

#2 yeah batteries go nuts when they catch fire and 3k of them will just keep going nuts. Going to need a like grappling hook and dunk tank setup for all the electrics as the transition to them being the norm happens.[deleted]"BuT ItS gOt A FivE sTaR CrAsH RaTiNg"What a terrible fucking threadOof. Tesla fanboys are out in full force all over social media.100% do not think this is Tesla’s fault. 100% driver fault here.this is why tesla needs to stop advertising it as "auto pilot." it's cruise control with more sensors. keep your feet near the pedals, hands near the wheel and eyes on the road. Jesus.The article have updated and the fire crew called Tesla on how to stop the fire.  This is not why water was used but rather how difficult these ev car fires are to extinguish.Its about not having the infrastructure for the right tools to support EV, rooftop solar and battery fires.. That could be lithium smoke that is deadly to inhale in that steam vapor the 32000 gallons - what were they doing about evacuating the community around the fire and protecting the soil from contamination?Stock somehow climbs higherLol, Water.I mean. Lithium polymer! Makes great metal fires that cant be out out.[deleted]Perhaps Elon Musk could show up at the scene of the fire and launch the burning Tesla into space on a trajectory to Mars. They could use the burning Teslas to light the landing area for Elon's future Mars landing craft.Question: Would it help to build the cars so that they could automatically eject and unlink the batteries in a crash?Pretty sure water does nothing in that situation.i have a feeling that both were drunk and thought cant be pulled over for a dui if the car drives it self.Non Tesla driverless crash

I live vicariously through you. 

Every time I step into my car I close my eyes and picture myself driving a GT3.

Then I close my door and hear the rattles of a GM car. And my vision is gone 😨More like, the only choice for a supercar level performance in manual is just Porsche 911 GT3.I am not surprised at all. When we are talking about luxury sport cars, the person has enough disposable income to have two vehicles.Thats actually a shockingly high take rate...The 911 GT3, with a manual transmission and 9000 RPM engine, is the only car I could see replacing my S2000. Unfortunately, the GT3 is not within my budget.Weird that for regular cars the US market is almost entirely automatic, but in sports cars Americans buy manuals more than the rest of the world does.This is most likely a result of the manual Porsche being a future classic in the futurethis is great news because I really miss seeing manual transmission in these iconic race carsone of the last bastions of manual love.

Get em while they're hot boys, they wont' be around much longer

(oh wait I don't have 200k lying aroud)THERE IS HOPEResale spec.It's easier to put it in neutral to push around your garage full of ~~dust~~ collector cars.America! Fuck yeah!That 70% number needs more context. Like, how many have been sold? Makes a difference if they sold 10 versus 10k.Driven both PDK and manual and ended up with the gated. So different in terms of involvement and effort, but very rewarding. I would get bored of the auto in a second. With stick, there’s always something different when you drive it. It’s gearbox is notchy and firm but precise.Previous discussion on this found here: 

www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/lrpu23/the_last_911_gt3s_manual_take_rate_surprised_even/Is there a compilation of all the manual take rates released by companies? It would be interesting to compare and see who has the highest.This is less an indication that people want manuals and more an indication that the GT3 is the best option for the few remaining people that want manuals.Oh yeah, well 100% of Honda Civic Si buyers bought the manual transmission.Great to see that, but unfortunately it was actually mostly due to resale value. Most GT3 buyers have driven stick at one point or another, but their choice for transmission was rarely due to driving novelty. Perhaps 3 out of 10 people who are A) rich enough to afford B) young enough to take the pummeling (<50 yrs) and C) educated to drive manual. That’s a rather limited crowd. Social media leaves us to believe that young people everywhere had GT3’s, but the typical buyer for these cars was 50+ and would garage queen it. 

Became widely known that PDK were going way below what Manual’s were doing, so everyone brushed off the old manual driving skills. Same goes for the bucket seats. I would say 90% of people would prefer the sport comfort seat for actual driving (as would their wives), but they know speccing a car without buckets would also kill the resale value. That’s strictly speaking for Americans. Europeans seem to not care as much and actually value the daily driving benefits more than resale value. You see a lot more Sport Comfort seats and manuals because they actually drive them. Thus how the GT3 Touring came about..Kinda no brainer for a GT3Coming here from r/All this is interesting to me because my boss has like 6 GT3s. Only one is manual, and it's his least favorite because of it. Different strokes I guessSave the manuals.Wow a Manual stat that beat my GTOs 60% sold as manual great to see.I really hope reports of these numbers show the auto industry that people want the 3rd pedal option.

Literally the only thing keeping me from getting an Audi RS3 right now is the fact that it's only offered in auto.

Manufacturers have become too obsessed with 0-60 times, it's a dick measuring contest now. I would gladly sacrifice 0.5 or 1 second to 60mph if it meant I got to enjoy every second of my driving experience more. The joy of constant shifting far outweighs the short lived joy of occasionally being able to launch it.few thoughts on this article

* The 6 speed in the GT3 is one of the few truly great manual transmissions still out there. It is night-and-day different from the 7-speed manuals in the rest of the 911 lineup
* Most manual transmissions are not great. The GT3 is one exception, the GT350 is another. Miata another good one. 
* Examples of vague/poor manuals:  non-Shelby Mustangs, Camaros, Corvettes, BMWs, nearly every sports car out there. 
* Why is this? Manuals are now an afterthought for vast majority of cars, it is only those few exceptions I mentioned above where the manual is the PRIMARY option for the car. In all other cases, performance and synergy with the rest of the powertrain is done with the automatic transmission in mind.
* There are still some random economy cars out there that have great shifters - I call these happy accidents. Older Civics are a perfect example, I'm sure there are others (new Corolla?).When in Rome...Hell yeahAs you fucking should!so like 7 out of 10 people?[deleted]This is the way.Funny, the GT3 is the first and only sports car I've bought that was an "automatic". PDK is a masterpiece, and sets the standard for the entire industry.

Any other car, short of a Ferrari/Lambo/McLaren, I'll take a manual for sure.Didn't Aston Martin say a couple years ago that they want to be the last brand making manual cars? There is hopeThe manual car market share has always baffled me, manufacturers say can't sell them new, but then once production ends manuals end up holding more value or even appreciate compared to automatic versions, making the argument that "manual lovers don't buy them or can't afford them" irrelevant because the demand is clearly strong. Go look up Ferrari 599 prices and then compare manuals and auto prices, how does insufficient demand drive it's price to higher than sticker once production stops?My close friend bought a GT3 RS but he bought it with paddles, thing shifts stupid fast and sounds amazing! Ironically it's the same color as on the photo, badass car but too much for your boi lolThere should not exist a GT3 with an auto trans.  This makes me sad.30% are dumbassThey offer an automatic?  Why?Porsche owners have constantly demanded they keep the manual and Porsche has respectfully obliged🏎💪🏽💪🏽 sadly all the other companies  went south on this or maybe the fans should’ve been more demanding 🤔Having driven a recent 911 Turbo S with the PDK, anyone shitting on that transmission choice is a fool.

It's perfectly fine to prefer the manual, especially on the GT3 of all Porsches, but there's no need to shit on PDK users. Its honestly probably the best transmission in a road car right now.

The whole "enthusiasts only want manual" garbage on this sub is such an old mentality that ignores that technology and the world is slowly moving on whether you like it or not. Fastest drivers in the world don't do it with a stick (F1), you telling me your car is more thrilling to drive? Let's keep it real.I don't think there is enough love here for the pdk. I would take the pdk over the manual. Shifting in lightning quick times is so satisfying and also I'm lazy and want to press 1 button to shiftPerfectly balanced, as all things should be.That’s something I wouldn’t have though and it makes me happyAw yiss, a story by Stef made it to r/cars front page!This is the wayFor me, the main selling point for the GT3 was the manual option, which was brought back in 2018.  A couple of things stopped me from getting one.  The first was I am not going to pay AMV to the Porsche stealership, the second I have already owned four Porsches.  Hindsight, I am very happy with my current ride, even with the DCT.Awesome means more manual transmission gt3 will be available later on in the used market.Wow I just love this statistic.What's wrong with the other 30%?A surprise to be sure, but a welcome oneI used to prefer manual over automatic. That changed after a Porsche appreciation day at a track. PDK transmission is magic.Why wouldn't you? I know DSG's and other sequential autos are butter smooth but there's no other feeling than shifting through gears, especially in a fucking GT3. Viagra even for the most severe ED.You guys are actually walking the talk unlike many of us in this sub (were too poor to contribute). I can't thank you enough.I think that its really important to mention that this option was added **back**. I think a lot of people who wanted a manual transmission in a car like this held out, and when the 911 GT3 became available with a manual again, they all went out and bought it. 

If this trend continues, then I will be properly surprisedAnd they say manuals are deadThis is the way!Don't get mad at automatic owners. Who doesn't like a nice burger and soda on a road trip? It's hard to eat when you're shifting.It’s not faster, it’s more funThis is what I’m buying with my tendies. 💎🙌🏻Unpopular opinion, but 70% of those chose the inferior transmission.     
As a Porsche tech, I have driven both the manual and the PDK. For a Base or an S 911 the manual is perfect. But feels completely out of place in a GT3, the whole reason to get a GT3 is for it's track performance, and if you are a track driver you should care about lap times. The PDK will yeilds better lap times for any driver.    
The manual transmission is for those Porsche owners wearing their PCA jacket and just go to cars and coffee and talk about "purity" then shift like a grandmother.Because why _the fuck_ would I ever buy a sports car that I can't shift myself. Half the fun is in feeling the engine. Can't do that with a shitty automatic.

(note: I completely realize that it is "sub-optimal" to do your own shifting.)Momma raised them rightThis restores my faith in humanity.[deleted]70% of them also only went to cars and coffee..WTF were 30% thinking?what kind of person gets an automatic Porsche?


*Looks like I triggered some people.. sorry.I wonder how many of these are collector/show pieces. I bet more pdks are sold in Germany because most of them end up getting used in Nurburgring etc.Those that would prefer an automatic would likely prefer a turbo, surprised this doesn’t carry over abroad.I mean duh. If you want to really *drive* and enjoy and more importantly *experience* the ride you want a manual transmission. Automatic is for comfort and that's fine but it'll never beat manual in terms of experience and fun. And if you buy something as great as this you obviously don't want to sully it with automatic.Imagine someone buying a GT3 for fun and enthusiasm rather than as a professional lap driver eking out the top track times.  It’s almost like people think of it as some kind of racy street car or weekend track fun car more than they do as a weekend timed event car.  Or perhaps they like it better from a long-term investment perspective.This makes sense. You want to enjoy a sports car not just brag about “0-60 Time” or slightly improved MPG that comes with Auto/CVTs.

I have owned automatic and manual cars. For some reason I grow more attached to manual transmission cars. I feel that a lot of a vehicles personality can be lost when its a computer doing all the shifting for you. Manual transmission is also a good anti-theft device in itself as only 5-10% of people can drive one. 

Plus manual transmission is easier to service and repair. If you know how to drive one you can keep it going for a long, long time. Transmission failure is the most common reason older cars are thrown away to the junkyard. 

When I go to buy my GT3 I wont even consider the PDK option. The sports car I save years to buy needs to be something I will enjoy the shit out of.Like I said in the thread before. Do not take this as some sort of indication or belief that there is a manual transmission revival. Porsche GT3 sales are probably the opposite of overall sales trends.70% of porsche 911 gt3 buyers overestimate their ability to change gearsHaving experienced both the manual and PDK version, PDK ALL DAY.I wish I was one of them. Sadly I can not afford one 😄Millennial anti-theft devicesDoesn't mean much. It just shows that those who can afford these cars are looking at it as an investment. The manual take rate for regular 911 is between 20-25%.The car I dream of driving while I roll around in my $4000 Kia Forte shitbox.  Sigh.  Come on lotto!!How many of those bought it with ambitions that it will be worth 2x because it was stick?Why spend that much money for a street legal racecar and choose the option which will make you slower on a racetrack?

Unless the thought is that it will hold value on secondary marketSeriously what kind of fucking idiot would get an automatic Porsche? I'm genuinely surprised they make them.Can confirm, manual GT3’s are a TON of fun.I love this. The PDK GT3 is almost a half second faster to 60. Drivers read that, and think as I think: who gives a shit. I’m buying this to drive in, not ride along with.Getting a GT3 with an automatic would be like leaving the training wheels on my mountain bike.I'm sad about the c8 corvette not having a manual transmission.

Yes an automatic can shift faster than a human. The feeling of physically change gears to go faster is addictive. The urge for that will never go away.[deleted]Auto should be illegal.What is the percentage of GT3 owners taking the vehicle to the track?I mean if you want something to throw around on a mountain pass, It's gonna be this one.Isn't that the point of buying a GT3?A gentle reminder to newcomers that while discussion about policy is usually okay, politics or comments leading to politics are not allowed in /r/cars.

https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/wiki/politics[deleted][deleted]I drive a 97 Integra GSR with 365,000 miles on it and I'm never selling it.I’m down. The last new car I bought I drove for over 12 years and I plan to do the same for the car I bought a couple of years ago. The longer you plan on holding on to your vehicle, the better shape it’ll be in when you do eventually get rid of it as well. By the time I got rid of the 350z I had, it was easily nicer than just about every other one on the market as I’d actually stayed on top of maintenance and hadn’t done any silly modifications to it. There are many benefits to trying to keep one’s “car ADD” under control.People are buying cars less, marrying less, having kids less, buying homes less, saving less...you’d almost think there is some bigger issue to explain what is happening.[deleted]Cars are lasting longer. You wouldn't know it based on reddit, but reliability is way up across all brands over the last 30 years (I'm talking brands as a whole, not specific models, there are surely some bad ones).Hahaha Americans are keeping their cars longer.


Meanwhile in Serbia: Golf 2 and YugoNew cars are far more capable of it than they ever have been. It's not uncommon for even basic cars to reach 150k miles or more even with poor maintenance. And there are more cars than ever capable of 250k plus with good maintenance.TBH I cant afford this shit, my last two car purchases have been out of desperation. And I STILL cant really afford the finance payments.I just sold my 2008 Honda Civic Si for around 5k. The market is insaneMine hit 20 this year. Still runs great.My rsx 5 speed has 200k miles 17 years old. I’ll be driving it forever.\*Looks at my corolla*, we have many years ahead my friendJust bought a 2008 GX470 with 178K miles, good service record for $10K. The 2UZ-FE is bulletproof if maintained. Plenty of 300K+ mile GXs that reliably climb boulders. I'm keeping this sucker for a long time.Cars are also higher quality now (it at least, it seems like it anecdotally).

I have a couple cars from 2013-2015 and they feel just like “new” to me.  Never had an itch to upgrade and I still feel like I’m breaking them in. 

Or maybe this says more about my mental age psychologically, because I still think of any car 2012+ onward as “modern.”  As long as they have push-to-start and a decent screen, that’s as much tech as I need.True, I see people with 90s shitboxes all the timeI have a driveway full of cars over 10 years old and one new one leased last year. The leased one is a daily driver and it'll get replaced with a hybrid truck as soon as those are a thing.I got divorced in 2019, having a car payment is not in the books for me right now considering child support etc. I have no choice but to keep my 12 year old car(bought in 2012), that and I dont hate it either. Its fairly simple to work on with out a million sensors to worry about. I just wish Honda didnt cheap out on the paint. I had parts of the car repainted per the extended warranty, but every other body panel is chipping clear.

I am a little less worried now that my job has had us working from home for over a year now. I crested 200k miles on the car this year.Alternative headline - New Cars are becoming more and more unaffordable while Americans see little adjustment for cost of living12 year toyota ownership here. Only have 90k on her too, bought new in 09. Don't drive much because of WFH. I love not having a car payment and insurance is dirt cheap.Nows the best time buy a motorcycle not a car. They haven't climbed much in price reallyCant really say that's surprising given how reliable cars have gotten. Pretty much any vehicle you can buy now will get you to 175k miles with basic maintenance.the thought of having to replace my older cars with something having a touchscreen and $1500 light bezels makes me really uneasy.  I'm hoping those design features are just a phase. (my dailies are a '99 and an '03 - each with less than 150k on them)[removed][deleted]Most people dont care about their car, as long as it drives it's fine.Honda’s, Toyota’s, GM’s with the 3.8, and pickup trucks are stuff I see regularly at old age.12?!  

My 90s 4Runner is a classic. Sadly it has to be smog every 2 years. At least my dad’s El Camino doesn’t need smog and can utilize any engine going forward.I love my old shit. 07 motorcycle, 09 motorcycle, 06 truck, and 05 truck.Someone just told me yesterday they’d give me $4k for my 96 Cherokee stick, they said even with the rusted out rockers and hole in the floor. Nope not for sale. If that’s what they’re going for I couldn’t afford to replace it.I still have no idea how people afford new cars. My daily is turning twenty soon.Anyone buying a car right now is an absolute clown. Anyone selling a car right now is big smart moves. Once the semi-conductor shortage smooths out prices are going to drop/go back to relatively normal levels. Just sit on what you got and wait it out if you're buying, it'll be worth the thousands you save.

You'll see this change once ev adoption picks up in the next few years[deleted]Toyota Corolla going on 11 years now.I'm curious if it's normally distributed. Because that means there are a lot 15-20 year hold cars on the road. 

This is actually one of the biggest reasons I'm skeptical of the electric future. The cars coming out today are just as likely to be 12-year-held cars. And ICE vehicles still make up 95% of all sales. And of the 5% electric part a lot of that is plug-in hybrid. This almost guarantees that in 12-13-years the average car driven will still be have an ICE.Id sure hope so. This make to break bs shouldnt be allowedShit tends to happen when you have no middle class and bunch of people who can barely pay the bills.\*Late Stage Capitalism Makes it Impossible for Americans to Afford a New Vehicle

There fixed your title.No shit charge and arm n a leg for a car n gas and insurance and city sticker and plate sticker.. tf u expect and if u wanna park anywhere in the city u gotta pay smh ...Because a huge chunk of our population is under the poverty line, or if we do make a livable wage, it immediately goes to pay off bad debts.

We're basically trapped getting underpaid and paying  off endless debt rather than investing in new products or assets.

I would seriously go right now and try to order a Bronco if I had the income. I'm driving 2 30+ year old cars, and it's not a lifestyle choice, it's because I'm fucking poor and trapped by debtMine just had her 21st birthday and i’m taking her to the grave. I don’t like any of the new stuffAm a brazilian, since most of the cars I see are Corsas (late 90's-early 00's), older Gols (early 90's-early 00's), the Escort XR3, Unos and other older cars, I'm not surprised at all about Americans buying older cars lmao.

Money could be an issue tho - I think it's just people realizing they can just buy an economy 1.0 car and use that saved money for other stuff (of which fuel would be one of them). I think it's that - if I ever buy a car I think it's going to be a boring cheapo 1.0 engine car that I could actually afford.I want to buy 2nd gen honda odyssey are good. Yeah, the price is not bad but I will trade my 2002 ford focus for it I just got.That is interesting. Here in The Netherlands I think the opposite is true. I've been seeing a lot more newer cars on the roads compared to the past.I'm trying to buy a car right now just started looking the prices are nuts. They want way way to much.If you keep your car maintained it will last a long time. I work as a service advisor at a small shop in Colorado and we see vehicles of all makes and models with over 300 k miles/ 10 years on them and still going strong. These people keep their cars repaired and maintained and drive them as long as it’s economical to do so. And business is booming in large part because of people keeping their vehicles longer.I sell cars, about 13 years in the industry. A couple of things happening here, cars are more reliable in general, so keeping them longer makes sense. But also, I don't have any reasonably priced cars to sell to folks looking to buy. Wholesale prices are up 40% on average just since JANUARY of this year. It is batshit insane out here. And for new? We make an order from the MFG and they just shrug and say "you'll get them when you get them, we've got no clue when we can make your order." It's pretty wild, a multitude of factors are cranking prices up to insane levels. One thing that I am concerned about with prices where they are, is that they will go back down, and I believe quite rapidly, once supply resumes to a normal level. Even at these inflated prices, lenders are going 120% LTV for prime credit, so when prices come back down, so so many people are going to be upside down and buried.The fact that the average new car price is ~$38k doesn’t help… it’s insane.My car is 18byears old. So... Does this mean I'm doing my part?I just swapped my WRXs motor. Im not ever letting this car die.People are financing cars out to 80 months. I’m driving our cars till they explode. I get that you need a car so sometimes there isn’t a choice but screw thatThis isn't news.. just like less people owning houses, and less people buying diamonds.. no one can afford it.Husband's Toyota Highlander has ~134K miles.  It's from 2003.  

My Toyota Solara has ~60K miles.  It's from 2006.  The tires rot from age before they lose tread.  

(Oddly, autocorrect changed that to "loose."  WTF, autocorrect?!)It doesn't help that people can't afford new carsMore like millenials can’t buy new cars because of huge cost of livingPeople can't afford shit.So this is a good thing right? Since it takes wayyy more carbon emissions to make a new car vs operating a car for 30+years?Maybe bc a new car is like 40+ grand?I see only 2 possible reasons :  
1. Cars are more reliable than ever  
2. People cant afford a new car because the rate of increase of pay is not proportional to the rate of increase of cost of living.

Your pick.Your average reddit that lurks don't have big balling cash.

Saving money on little things ain't gonna be enough to buy a nice car, let's be a buck 50. It's just all about incomes staying stagnant for the majority.

I don't get why it's so bad to call it how it isWell done you just sealed the deal on this kid being a car nut. I see his future bank account withering away already! 

All joke aside what are you driving OP?You might as well have given your brother a hit off a crack pipe

He's a lifer now. I love itI didn't expect this post to gain much attention. I was wrong! 

When I was my lil bro's age, my cousin was into cars and he took me for a ride in his big-ish turbo mk3 supra. I had the same exact reaction and I remember the feeling of joy /terror like it was yesterday. 
I've been hooked ever since. 

My cousin suddenly passed away from an aneurysm two years ago and it really hit me hard. RIP my dude, you lit up my passion for the rest my life and I hope I can do the same for people.

Edit: Holy heck people! Thank you so much for the love! I truly appreciate the kind words! I told my lil bro he's famous now and people love his reaction, he just smiled a big... then asked if he drive the Corvette 😂... I said no of course, but I told him maybe the miata tomorrow.  Wish me luckThis is the best post on cars subreddit I’ve seen. I’m happy your brother is here with you in America getting to enjoy the badass cars and making memories! Keep being a great brother.I rented a 911 GT3 awhile back and took my daughter for a ride. I went WOT on a side street, and the amount of screaming laughter and legitimate tears of terror coming down her face made me start laughing so hard I had to stop.

 One of my best dad moments to date. Wish I had a video of it.[The moment](https://i.imgur.com/LDiJKR9.png) he left this dimension.Pure joyYou just programmed the kids brain for speed. His face says it all.  Such unadulterated joy. Hide your keys!I'm willing to be most car nuts have had something similar in their childhood.

Unlike most families, the woman in my family seem to be the motorheads. Growing up my mother had corvettes, Fiat X1/9, muscle cars, etc. My sister, who is about 10 years older than me, bought a new Z-28 around 1980. At the time all cars were slow as hell but as a 9 year old, everything seems fast. It was a stick and I remember her going through the gears(4) and each time she gunned it the air induction hood flappers would open up. Every time I rode with her I would try and get her to activate the flappers.I just broke up with my gf yesterday, and I’ve been super sad lately.

Turns out shit like this makes cry. Who knew.You know what's incredibly annoying? The pull videos with a model with huge boobs in the passenger seat who couldn't care about cars any less and is getting paid.

You know what restored my car faith in humanity? This video. Well doneThat was awesome! I love the bug eyes when you first get on it.This is what cars are all about, the sheer joy and excitement it should bring to someone's face. It's priceless. I'm glad your brother got to experience it, I have cousins from less affluent countries where cars are expensive and anything fast, interesting, or super fun can cost a fortune. It really can be life changing for them to experience a car that's just beyond what they have experienced (whether it's fast, off-road capable, or luxurious).his face is priceless!Little brother's look of pure joy says it all.  I'm pretty sure I had a similar look and reaction the first time my dad took me for a ride in a Mustang GT.  I was already interested in cars as a youngster but that ride cemented me as a car enthusiast for life.

Thanks for sharing this bit of happiness with us.  It's really awesome to see!Cars are the best. Those memories will be with him foreverI knew a guy who took a salesman visiting his firm for a quick ride in his. He lost control and hit a tree, killing him. That second gear can be quite dangerous. Be careful out there...طقع.I love it!

But please remove the jack handle from the back. If you get rear ended it might impale the back window. If you rear end someone it might impale you.That was me when my dad got his 95 Z28. I remember this slight delay between the sound of the engine roaring up and the power getting to the wheels and just this explosion of acceleration.So cool! You have any pictures of the C6?OP. When the stuff in the back slid forward. Were you braking? Or was that just from letting off the accelerator? Impressive if it was.Welcome to America (to him)  :)    I hope he enjoys it here! 

&#x200B;

Also look into Autocrossing or track days.  super fun, esp with a car like that :DBeautiful display of pride and joy right there my man! Kudos to you for waking him up with a WOT pull! Permagrin is real, and forever etched into his psyche!!Looks fun!What an amazing reaction. Very cool.tfw no big bro like you growing up. ;_;

keep it up 👌That's pure, wholesome joy right there!Big props for you and prosperity for your lil bro!Someone should repost this to /r/MadeMeSmilebrb trying to remember the last time I was that happy.Ah yes the American dreamThat was my reaction to my first ride along in a very fast car. It was all downhill from there....This absolutely brightened my day. I’ve been going through some real shit, and it’s nice to be reminded of the simple pleasures of life sometimes. 

Thanks man!Pure enjoyment. Love this feelingHorsepower always brings out the biggest smiles😁pure wide-eyed joy. This is wholesome AF>Can confirm, he’s locked in.  My neighbor took me for a similar ride in a ‘67 Mustang and I was hooked from there on.  

Teach him the joys of competitive racing and karting, maybe he’ll get into some formula stuff and advance from there.His reaction is absolutely priceless lmaoOh man, this one really warmed my heart. The way his eyes lit up and let out that short-winded "woo!" at the end - brings me back to that initial spark that evolved into my lifelong love for cars.You are the coolest older brother dude. He looks so happy! 😂That's what the birth of a gearhrad looks like!This made my dayI loved this, the look on his face is priceless.  Thanks for posting.I needed to see the joy on your bro’s face. Made my day.BrilliantMost wholesome post on here I’ve seen in a whileWholesome moment, thx for sharing OP!I like how “lil pull” is to the top of third gear lolz.Damn bro you’re like 40 years older than him is he a step bro or somethingThat was pure joy on his face. AWESOME!

Thanks for sharing!Hehehe nice! Get em hooked on cars young so they don’t spend their money on drugsGod I love me a good ol manual transit car.How wholesome. This is the kind of stuff that inspires others to become auto enthusiasts :)I think he had a little tear of joy at the end there.That does it. I'm doing the school pick-up in the Skyline today.

Thanks for this video.If that doesn't get him into cars idk what will bro hahaha what a good brother. Start of a beautiful passionThis is the wholesome shit I like to see, Just two bros bonding over speed and PowerYou just cannot put a price on that face. Well done big bro!Hell yeah.

❤️Love the pure joy.Man I don't know if you will read this but thank you. When I was young my brother did the same to me, in a ferrari owned by his boss. Sadly my brother died before he could even see my driving licence, he always wished to buy me a car at 18. It was one of his dreams because no one did it for him and he had to buy his own car.

This reminded me so much of him, of all the fun we've had in his cars and all the road trips. Even though im writing this while holding my tears so my wife doesn't hear me cry, they are happy tears OP. They are tears from reliving those beautiful memories.

Please spend all the time in the world with your brother, you may not realise but you for sure mean the world to him. Take care of each other, please.This makes me so happy, and oddly enough, really patriotic.

Props to you for showing him a good time. Glad you two are reunited!My turn!!:08

Welcome to the United States of America!

He is every one of us in here, lads.That day, this kid became a car guyI was wondering at first what car it was, then read your username and was like NO WAY!! I have a 12' speed 3 and know exactly who you are! That corvette is badass!What a contagious smile!Haha, his face as soon as he’s pushed back into the seat is AWESOME!! 
Welcome to America little brother, where we go big with everything!! 
Good for you man, wish you both the best, and hope he enjoys America! 
Who knows, maybe one day you’re sitting in the seat of HIS corvette![removed]My heart is racing. Sweet pull he was thrilled for sure. God I love horsepowerhis face as soon as you get on it..wholesome af  hahaWhat exhaust and other mods?  Sounds fantastic. Any exterior pics?Haha that was amazing. Pure, 100% joy on his face. Can't help but smile watching this.that exhaust sound is dirtyyyyMan that reaction is awesome. That makes me smile[deleted]I can’t officially condone such recklessness...you legendary big broSo overspeeding.Quit driving like a fucking retard on public streetsYou are the worst kind of American.[deleted]I'm sorry, what?That can't be good for the environment... Kids gonna die from climate change, but at least this ride was fun.This really brought back memories. Thanks for sharing.Well now he’s definitely gonna be a car guy 😂The absolute joy on his face is so heart warming. He’s lucky to have a brother like you!Fuckin awesome man.Wholesome afThe instant joy, wow.This makes me happy.Wow that's a memory he'll have for life! Thanks for sharing, OP.

Reminds me of when my brother would take me in his big turbo A4, definitely pushed 12 year old me into the seat.Wholesome as fuck, I remember my older brother doing something similar for me. Had the same effect more or less. Good on you!Thank you for being a great brother! It really warms my heartI was just like that the first time I experienced a porsche cayman pull but like 10 years older.Haha his face when you start pulling is priceless."I did not know man could build such things"...Mild Deja Vu here for me. A similar occurrence with my Uncle (and his TVR) is what got me into cars, fibreglass and a V8 is clearly still the way to go!Man this was exactly me a year ago when my cousin did a pull on their Model SThis was hilarious!BeautifulInstant good times right there.You've just created a car enthusiast for lifeThat's awesome man! Sick car tooHomie just became a gear head like the rest of us😂Surprise hits are the best. You almost can't catch your breath.You put his eyes into the back of his head haha, no doubt he will remember that for the rest of his life.That look on his face is priceless!It's stuff like that makes me feel blessed to be a part of this community. That smile says everything, kid is one of us now!!That face is priceless.love how he looks over between 2nd and 3rd.  WHAP right back into the seat in 3rd.That’s so cool, very wholesome reaction!This is so amazing!!This is so wholesome it makes me want to die. Even more so than usual.It's funny how he tries to look at you but acceleration slams him back into the seat.The first one's free. This is how car guys are born, I can quit whenever I want.did that almost get away from you there?He wasn’t ready... no, no... he wasn’t ready! -Kevin HartGe3kspd! I follow you on Instagram and have seen your track day and autocross videos for years now. Love this clip! Which have you enjoyed driving more, the MS3 or the C6?the joy on his face was priceless. 

that table leg or what it was that was about to go flying when you braked though.. never good to have a bunch of stuff that might fly into the cabin.When I saw your bros face light up my face lit up too lol. You're a good bro. And that sound is just so good.Reminds me of when I was a kid and my big brother took me out in fast cars. I totally understood how your kid brother felt when watching that. Kudos to you big broThis is wholesome asf. He's lucky to have you ❤️Man I wish my older brother had a corvette lolI like how you can see his head get pushed back at the gear changes lol. He’s gonna be a car nut soonWhen you're brother said "hogaya", it made me smile!Such a pure reaction, I’m sure he’ll hold that memory for all time now. Awesome!Wholesome as fuck!Here a hundred dollar bill on the dash if you can catch it while I accelerate it’s yours.Those is one of my fav videos I've seen on reddit in years. Genuine joy is something this world could use a lot more of.My new favorite video! The look of joy on his face, the sound of that car, and he will NEVER forget that! Perfect videoLocal! 

I want to get onto NJMP next year just to have some fast fun in my car. It’s not physically possible for me to heel-toe, so I just want to get out there and have some smiles - not spend tons of money thinking I can be competitive in anything. 

What is the best way to do that here? HPDE? I don’t understand what half the events on their calendar mean!That motor sounds very healthy. Thanks for sharing this moment.Almost brought tears to my eyes vibes brotherBruhhlilWe all remember our first time.

Mine was also in a Corvette.What a perfect video...reaction was priceless...awesome stuffIts like watching a human brain receive crack visually in the face....amazing. Welcome to the money pit kidThe best feeling he'll have until girls get involved!!! You're a great big brother!!!! Mad props!!!He went home and started calculating how much he needs to save per year to get one of his ownLiterally r/humansbeingbrosand a lifelong addiction to cars and performance mods has been sparked...What’s an “RR”?Hell yea!  I remember being thrown back to my seat at that age. You never forget moments like thatThat face man! His reaction is such a good demonstration of everything I love most about cars. 

Glad you get to spend some quality time sharing that with your brother man, mine is on a separate continent as well, it's always tough. Cheers brotherThat first time though☺️Cool bro...However you need to strap down or get a cover for the crap that's in the hatch area, coming to an emergency stop that stuff could become a projectile and hit you or your passenger in the head...Looks like me the first time I stepped on it in my coworkers Tesla. 

(Also the only car I've ever managed to make myself a little carsick in. Regenerative braking take a while to get used to)I want to do this with my little brother so bad... awesome vid!!My brother did the same to me with an Impala Chevy. No-one else in my family drove hard, so seeing the speedo needle go waaay over the far side while the engine roared up front was something that stayed with me for decades. 

Cheers for bringing the memory back mate.This brought me genuine joy. His smile and that giggle, I hope you two have a long future of bonding over cars.That is the sweetest dang video I've seen in forever.Y'all are sweet. It warmed my heart to see your little brother's reaction.You've just awakened something. You can see it in his eyes. The roar of the engine, the power at your feet. He's going to be like you.Holy fuck. Those eyes!! 😆 Looks like he enjoyed that!!For a z51, that things sounds nasty. What sort of engine/exhaust mods have you done?Lol bro that’s Cocaine and Jaegermeister.Damn your parents had you i take it in...1990? And him in 2008?  Your parents shag like bunnies =)That was awesome. Really wish I had had someone with cool cars when I was growing up. Would’ve been into cars much earlier.Aaaaaaand car addiction.Totally worth it just to see his smile!Very cool thanks for sharing! That wing though...You're a good brother.This makes me wish I had a lil broNice profile picture on your yt account. I also have a mazdaspeed and a miata. It’s the perfect combo.This gave me the biggest grin ever. Thank youNice of you to shoot an entire ad campaign for Corvette[removed]I didnt even look at your username until some one else pointed it out. Immediately recognized it! Been following you for years on instagram, love your cars!that brought i smile to my face😊 
i wish me and my brother we still closeSARI! Didn't expect to see you on Reddit. Been seeing you around since the Mazdaspeed3 days.

Did you sell the Miata? 😥He's hooked lol good job!!Thats the way you do it. 3 gears on the pipe!!

Proper.And the Most Awesome Big Brother of the Year award goes to... YOU!Lol pure joy .. bottle that and make a mint!!!Don't let him raceOlder brothers always have the fastest carslegendary big bro vibes, very cool.Awesome 😊👍That’s a bonding moment right there.God that brings back memories of my Dad and I driving his factory five Shelby cobra he built. Boy that thing could get goin.Odd this made me cryPriceless...

I mean it takes a C6 but priceless none the less.Bro. He is a car guy now. Through and through. My first time was a Porsche Carrera GT. He will remember that for the rest of his life.Reminds me of [this](https://youtu.be/Jh3d_Qo3jTI)   
He felt that there should be many possible things, especially carsThat pure unfiltered joy, 👍You get em hooked on this so they have no time or money for any bad influences!Man, I got a little tear in my eye. That was amazing. Congrats on hatching a new little car guy.r/contagiouslaughterGod bless my brother. This video gave me so much joy.This is an awesome post. Have fun driving the car, the stick shift must be so fun to driveHonestly. This is all it takes to get them to love cars. 

My cousin did the same thing when I was a kid in the early 90s in a riced out Honda Civic. Wasn’t the fastest thing but I couldn’t tell the difference as a kid.That kid’s reaction is utterly infectious. He became a car guy in that moment no question (if he wasn’t already)My big brother used to do this all the time to/for me. 300 ZX's were powerful so makes senseThat’s the face of pure joy.I guess I need to wait until my cousin is old enough and show her full send in my YugoThat 3rd gear neck snap! Great job, this kid will be a car guy for lifeThe look on that kids face is priceless!Honestly, no one ever put me in a car like that, and gave me the chance like you did for your brother, but I still found a passion for cars along the way, oddly enough, after my step dad passed (he was one hell of a mechanic and had two classic cars). This is wholesome.We need picsThis is such an awesome video. I love his reaction and his head snapping back to the seat with every shift.

This is a prime example of why people love cars.THATS what cars are for!You’ve captured a moment he will surely never forget. His reaction is pricless.You’re a good brother. Shit like this is what got my attention too, my dad doing stupid pulls on his silly V6 Dakota. 

It doesn’t need to be a Ferrari, or a corvette like yours. It just has to make you giggle. 

I always say a persons car should make them smile. It doesn’t matter if it’s the performance or the style or the color or the interior. Whether it’s a Mercedes SUV or a Viper or a Veloster N or a WRX. 

For most it’s the second most expensive thing we buy, and when you turn it on and use it it should make you smile.Nice, I got one of those toys tooMy daughter loves to go fast. Her face just lights up! This is good stuff!His face was absolutely priceless!  Well done big brother!This is such wholesome content.

If you have a brother, cherish it.  You can't have that connection with anyone else.God damn that sounds good.His face is what makes this video. I knew EXACTLY what he was feeling the second I saw it, and I suspect most of the people in this sub have had felt it too. Hes hooked for life now, he'll chase this feeling in whatever car he can. 

Also RIP to his bank account.This is so darn cute!That's honestly precious.  As a younger brother, I loved it when my older bro used to show me cool stuff.Wholesome as fuck.You're a good brother! Look at that happy face! Absolutely lovelyThe face of joy, I love it. Good brother type shit.Good man, his face says it all.Congrats 🎉Another young man in the gasoline addicted family. WelcomeAs a “little brother” myself, you’ve made my day. His eyes... OMG. You’re the absolute best. What a day. I’ve got to go call my Brother. He did our version of this back in 1974. Thanks for letting me relive it. Keep making that little Brother’s eyes light up. He will never forget.Asalamalakim this is beautifulHilarious and heart warming, you’re a good big brother.Damn. You’re an awesome brother :)Friend of mine just got a c6 for stupid cheap because of some semi major cosmetic issues (got rear ended so the hatch was fucked and rear bumper is gone). He was considering just waterproofing the trunk space and just making it a corvette utte because a new hatch was stupid expensive. But he ended up getting one for free from a guy he used to work for. He turned that thing into an absolute drift missile and I really want one now lol.Coolest big broThat is the look of pure, unfiltered joy.This genuinely made me happy.I remember this feeling/reaction when my bad would take me for rides in his 3000GT VR4. Launching from 4-5k RPMs would be so thrilling and taking corners and turns made my day.Your brother is adorable!  Welcome.  May you live your best life.Me when I floored my miata for the first time.Man I’m jealous that this kid gets to experience this for the first time. I miss that feeling.Are you in the Philadelphia area?Cousin took me on a ride in his big turbo cavalier in the early 00s and that’s all it tookThank You for this. I grew up riding shotgun in the world of AHRA/NHRA anytime I could snake a ride through the lights. In my 50s it is still burnt into my soul.  Raw power is definitely an attention getter.There’s no coming back from this stage now, I am happy and sad for him. He will always see his money  parked for some car purchases.That literally put a smile on my face. Thanks for sharing this. Everyone has that first "HOLY SHIT THIS IS WHAT IT FEELS LIKE!" moment that just leaves you laughing.hooked for life, that's how you do itOh man! His reaction is priceless!This is incredible. If he wasn't already, you created a car fan.This reminds me of when my grandpa did a pull in his CTS-V when i was about that age.  Im sure I had a similar expression.Priceless!This is one of my favorite videos of all time. The look on his face, you really made his day! I wish I had a big bro like youahhhh I love the smile it brought to his face he’ll never forget that momentWow ! Best of luck to you twoThis is fucking awesome. Good one you OP.I always think about how we take things like riding in a car for granted here in USA. Some ppl from other countries would be in heaven drivinginstagram when you're looking for attentionShit in our blood manNext is 500 kmh, 310 and a bit miles per hourIn 8 minutes at 304mph you will travel 40.5 miles and with a 22 gallon fuel tank, you will have a fuel economy of 1.84 mpg, which seems surprisingly goodThe [rear](https://www.topgear.com/sites/default/files/styles/fit_1960x1102/public/images/news-article/carousel/2019/09/2154146f9ce7d7703758db293de941b0/09_ss300p_ehra-lessien.jpg?itok=3ZryA8al) looks so much better than the normal carImagine hitting a deer at that speed.

Edit:  Actually, maybe we shouldn't.It was driven by Andy Wallace who also was the driver that set [the world record in the McLaren F1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYmIfDAQ9Y0) at 391 km/h. Same track too.I'm no expert but I do believe that is rather quick[deleted][deleted]That's 490.48 kilometres per hour for all us non-Americans.I'll always remember Clarkson claiming, back in the 00's, that the Veyron was a "Concorde moment" and "would never be matched in our lifetimes".   


Bugatti's response appears to have been a resounding "lol ok".“Ah shit missed my exit”What I find absolutely mad is that he's going 450+ and yet the car looks about as stable as mine doing 160 on the highway. Mental engineering behing that machine.> Andy Wallace hit a vmax of 304.77mph in a modified Chiron at Ehra-Lessien, becoming the first hypercar to break 300mph.

I wonder what was modified.  Did I see some fender vents?  I'm no Chiron expert, but stock pics, vs this record setting one, it looks like they used a whole new front bumper cover as well.


In no way am I taking away from this insane speed, but if the car isn't for sale as is....then Koenigsegg still holds the record for the fastest production car.That's going to be hard to beat seeing as VW sure as hell ain't gonna let koenigsegg or any competitor run on their track lmaoIt's just not the same without [Captain Slow.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO0PgyPWE3o)Pathetic, my Citroen will do 306But can it do mad skids with lunch trays under the back wheels behind the PE sheds?u wot m8. 

I feel like this came out of nowhere. So sick.Insane how it effortlessly pulls to 260 and even after that it builds speed incredibly fast imoHere it is: proof that 300mph can be broken on Michelin's best possible tyre. Now the question is the ceiling: what's the highest effective limit of that tyre? Because now I'm definitely thinking the Koenigsegg Jesko and other rivals can do it now. They can go past 305.The only question is how much road will it take, and how long can the tyre last for a two-way run.Congratulations Bugatti and all of those that worked on this, this is one hell of an achievement!Congratulations to everyone at bugatti except the cameraman and the editor.Did the portal to Highway 35 open?This thing looks fucking rad, I love the speed tail style rear end. Properly aggressive yet not over the topIt's actually crazy that you could have a car capable of doing 200mph and this fucking thing would still pass you at an extra 100mphStill surprised he didn’t get stuck behind a Prius going 49mph in the passing lane.Was this the same location used by Bugatti for their Veyron top speed run?Jesus Christ, the most impressive thing about the way a Bugatti builds insane speed is just how effortless it always looks. Even at 300+ mph, it looks like you're going for a fucking cruise down to your local orchestra. Amazing achievement for Bugatti; I was wondering for a while there if they were ever going to pull off a true top speed record run in the Chiron.

"But, it's not a production Chiron!" Yeah, well, from the looks of the more aggressive design, this thing will likely be an SS of sorts in the near future, and chances are, that car *will* be able to reach these speeds. And, more importantly, Bugatti are still the ones who have now hit 300 first versus the other big names in the car industry whom are focused on this. They are the ones who now have to respond to Bugatti.1905 - 100mph

1987 - 200mph

2019 - 300mphHennessy employees punchin the air right nowThey basically rebuild the Chiron, adds power and only do a one-way run on their own track which is probably soon going to be the only place where these records can be beaten. Meanwhile Koenigsegg decides against any modifications on the Agera RS, keeps all the aero bits/seats etc and does the run on a public road.  


While this is impressive af, I still think Bugatti not playing by the same rule book should put them in the same category of "unofficial records" as Hennessey.It looks kinda like bugatti gave the chiron a divo like front bumper and removed the 261 speed limiterThe regular Chiron already looked beautiful, but this looks somehow even better.Quick somebody tweet this Tesla. Lets see how they compare the model s to the chiron now.damn I was hoping to be the one to break the news@mods there are about 304.77 threads on the front page about this.I’m sure with their profit margins, another hyper car company could build a big long as hell test track if they really wanted to... 

I’m actually shocked some Middle Eastern dude hasn’t to be honest. I’d assume someone out there would love to host hypercar battles.“It’s the fastest car...IN THE WORLD...”I know we are getting more and more used to these crazy top speeds but this is just insane...I remember it being a huge deal in the 90s when cars like the McLaren and Diablo were hitting 200mph.Soon to be seen going 10mph in LA traffic.What modifications did they do in the engine and the drivetrain? I'm utterly curious and dying to know the real engineering behind this. Does anyone have some numbers for Final Delivered Torque, Output and Raw Power, Downforce, Lateral G's, Wind Shear Force, Acceleration-Time Graph, and Gear Shift-Time Graph during the test run?Pathetic, the plane I'm boarding in 2 days goes double that!Wow. This is history.It's cool and all, but until Bugatti actually release the SS or whatever this model will be called, Koenigsegg still has the record, and I predict so will the jesko 300I just can't wait for Koenigsegg's response to this :PThat's pretty nice, but its not a production car.

Watch Koenigsegg post a video next week where break 510 km/h in an Agera RS with a longer final gear...God, lifting (not even braking) at that speed must be like hitting a brick wall.I am surprised this was not known during Monterey Car Week as there was a heavy Bugatti presence and they’d already broken the record by then. Maybe the inner circle knew, but I didn’t hear anything about it.I wonder how much those tires cost lolBugatti- “lol wouldn’t it be funny if we purposely limited the Chiron to 263, even though we are well aware that it can easily pass the 300 mark?”Solo the orange on black paint job....this a Chiron supersport?Why is no one talking about how quiet that car is at 300+

I get to 85 in my car and I go practically deafRegardless of how practical this car may or may not be, it's just amazing how much progress has been made to reach such speeds. In the end, when the car is launched, you can still drive that wearing a tuxedo, connect your phone to it's infotainment and talk to your secretary to make sure you have your coffee waiting on your table while you drive the car to your office everyday. In the old days, you had to wear a helmet and a racing suit and find to drive something capable of hitting such speeds.Fucking incredible, what an achievement. Bugatti remains king of speed. Also I appreciate the lack of fluff in the video. No muss, no fuss, just balls-to-the-wall speed.Holy. Fucking. Shit.
That is absolutely insane, my hat comes off to the team behind that. After decades 300mph has finally been reached. What comes next?Bugatti: Is now known for being beaten for the production car speed record

Bugatti: Hold my beerHoly shit that's the first time ever right? No production car and I don't believe any non drag cars have ever hit 300mphDamn new world Record right?Son of a.bitch did it.

He goddam did itJust gave hennessy venom a big middle fingerIt took 74 years to get from 100-200 (Vauxhall 20-98 (1913) - Ferrari F40 (1987)) and it took 32 to get to 300.I’m surprised that they didn’t need a monster wing, like Formula 1 cars.Who’s next? SSC Tuatara or Jesko?1 mile per 12 secondsNow someone do it in a good looking carChristian has to get a comeback on this!Pffft, I bet my car could do thatHighway 35 here we come!The amount days I could save in a lifetime from driving that fast to and from work holy shit[deleted]Can you imagine doing 204mph in your V12 Ferrari thinking you're hot shit...then some fucker blows by you doing 100mph faster....I honestly cannot fathom that.

That being said, it's about time someone tested this car to it's actual limits, it's only been out for like, what, 2 years now? 3 maybe? And we're only just finding out how much faster it is than a Veyron SS's 268?They fucking did it, i thought that Hennessy F5 was going to do it first but people were tired of waiting i guess lolHoly shit they did it. They fucking did it. I've been wondering when they would do a speed test and now that Koenigsegg hit 283, they had to try and one up themThis is awesome and I love Bugatti, but let’s not forget some dudes in Texas did this with an ‘05 Ford GT in like February of this year. Also I highly doubt this is street legal so I’m still waiting for a full on “production” car to break the barrierDoes anybody know what tires were used?Is it me and my infantile expectations or did anyone else wish the car had done just a tad bit more and done 500kph?Technically its a pre production suped up chiron but congrats to bugatti and vw man that shits crazy 490 kmphI bet VW finds this ruling from their home country a little unsettling since they're going all-in on touch-only input in the id.3 and Golf 8.

&nbsp;

It's a mistake and a big reason why so many people prefer the interior of the Mk7's where everything is simple and intuitive to use without having to look away from the road. I think we'll see them backtrack much like Honda and other manufacturers have done.I really dislike this new trend among car manufacturers who make you control the airconditioning, music volume, etc through a single touchscreen. What we need are buttons and knobs which provide feedback and don't distract you while driving.I love love love technology, but I will never support touchscreen devices controlling things like aircon, volume, etc. Those functions need to be done without taking your eyes off the road, and should always be dials/buttons.

Edit: Some of the responses are interesting. Yes if a car is properly set up, you can blindly control things like volume, air temperature, air speed, etc, so you don't take your eyes off the road. There's SO MANY cars out there where you can't, so I can understand the confusion, but those are cars that are poorly designed. Also, voice control, imo, is not a reasonable replacement for physical controls, since voice control is notoriously unreliable.One of the reasons I like BMW's approach to keep the physical knobs and buttons.

Mine has a touchscreen, but I've hardly ever used it, and that's how I like it.And I agree.  You should *never* be forced to use a touch screen for things you're may be adjusting while driving.I thought I would hate the control knob in my Mazda that is used to control infotainment while you are driving (the touch is disabled on the touch screen while in motion). It is hands down a better system than a touch screen. Even Apple CarPlay is really easy to control with it. The Miata also has the 3 knob setup for HVAC control. I don’t think it can get any easier to control everything I need to while driving than this basic layout.

I find it ironic that people seem to associate this setup with cheapness because touchscreen controls are literally so the OEM can cut costs as much as possible (no buttons to manufacture/assemble and you can build software controls once and have them work for every car in the lineup greatly simplifying things).It's simple, really. If I need to take my eyes away from the road to control basic functions on my car, then it's shtty and potentially dangerous design. And that's why tactile feedback from buttons and switches are best for those sort of thingsAgreed. But you can't single out Tesla and not mention the others. 

Same rule should then apply to the likes of home grown companies like Audi and their new dual touchscreen center stack. 

To change the temp or seat adjustments you're essentially looking directly into the passenger foot well. 

At least with Tesla your head is up. Is it distracting? Sure, it can be if you're constantly fucking around with the screen. But there's worst out there in production and being developed.Link didn't work for me, but [this did](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53666222).Cars, the one industry where "the future" isn't always as "bright" as it seems.Good. Touchscreens in cars needs to die, or at least require physical interfaces in addition to touchscreen controls.I've long questioned how even a basic Ford touch screen for radio controls is "legal" but if I pick up my phone to look at already entered navigation, that's "illegal" but picking up a coffee is "legal."I find my Ford Focus touch screen distracting. I am not using it when I drive.So where is the line between distracting and not..? Need to make that clear. Is it by function? Ease of use?Fuck yeah.  I've been saying this for years.  The NHTSA should ban touchscreens in cars.  They suck hard and are a major distraction when driving.  I rent cars for work almost every week and not one car I have ever driven, including Tesla 3, has a touch screen that's worth a shit.As someone with experience around Tesla’s, I’ve never heard anyone complain and I think there is a lot of ignorance in this thread. The main use of the screen is for the map and rear view camera which can be left on while driving as it is a fisheye lens and helps cover blindspots. The other controls if needed can be accessed by buttons on the steering wheel as well as most of the car accessible by voice commands. Adding in the fact that the autopilot makes it less dangerous to glance over to the screen as a backup option, and there is really no reason that this is an issue in Tesla’s. I can’t speak for other cars however.I loooove tech in cars. However, physical buttons have their place. The whole point of tech is to improve something - things shouldn't be integrated into a touchscreen just for the sake of being integrated into a touchscreen. Make basic stuff like climate control, seat heating etc buttons and all interactive features in a touchscreen should be disabled when the car is in motion. Drivers should be fined if they are caught using their touchscreen when driving..duh? 


I never understood why touchscreens were allowed in cars, being that they're basically giant phones.

Except for money. I guess money is the reason.Honestly how hard is to include a scroller to control the tuchscreenlol good luck the Germans are all copying Tesla now.cant see how they arent distractingSome futile functions in new cars should be locked whenever the car is moving, period. All "essencial" controls should not require taking your eyes off the road. 

It makes no sense of the ruling concerns only Tesla and should be so for every manufacturer. How can they fight being on your phone while driving for years and be stupid enough to let it get to the point it is today?What modern higher end vehicle doesn't have touch screen controls?I dig Teslas and I kinda want to get one in the future. But the touch-only display is a deal breaker for me. Buttons with bevels, concave divets or raised edges have that tactile feel that allows for operation without taking your eyes off the road.

I know it looks cool, but I'm still shocked Elon Musk never saw a problem with his set up.I never understood how people could keep track of how fast they were going since the actual speed indicator is a little number in the corner of the screen. I’m always paranoid about how fast I’m going but with my truck I just glance down but glancing down and right seems like that much of an extra step; Tesla should’ve included a HUD in all there models standard for this very reason.I. Can't. Stand. Touchscreens in cars.

Give me analog/mechanical controls any day of the week.

Most of the touch inputs handle *Worse* than early touchscreen phones that had pressure sensitive screensI work next to a body shop, and the ratio of other cars to Tesla's there is always astounding. We have been trying to figure out what it is about those cars that leads to so many wrecks. My guess has always been that damn touch screen.I wonder what the German courts would say about the next generation S Class.Probably my only gripe with my car, I just wish the A/C temp/fan speed was a couple of buttons in the middle under the infotainment.

Instead there's a play/pause and volume, which I can control on the wheel and a passenger would have no trouble operating them through the touchscreen on the move as they're not driving!

Also Electric front/back window heaters, which I wouldn't mind being on the touch screen as I only ever use them when stationary anyway, plus they come on/off automatically anyway!Cue the “I don’t have any issues with it, I actually like Tesla’s interface”

.....HOWEVER, I can certainly see how it can be problematic for older drivers or those with poor dexterity or vision.All touchscreen consoles should be considered distracting devicesAll vehicle entertainment systems should be treated that way.Touchscreens and touch-capacitive controls should only work in park. Fight me.FUCKING THANK YOU.

I hate touchscreens in cars. Mazda is getting ahead and removing them from their vehicles after they did a study and found them to be more distracting than traditional interfaces.

It was extremely refreshing to hear Gordon Murray talk about the T50 and he goes out of his way to buck these trendy design choices that will not stand the test of timeAs a Telsa Model 3 owner 2+ years, I entirely agree.  

Touchscreens are well suited for settings which don't need to be adjusted while driving.  HVAC, lights, and wipers are not.

I'm glad for all the folks who don't feel this is a distraction.  More power to them.  For myself, the only concern I have is the lack of physical controls for these three things.

I can only hope legislation such as this causes ALL automakers to consider ergonomics and safety over cost savings and aesthetics.To be fair germany is just pissed that tesla is taking such a sizable chunk out of BMW, Merc, and Audi sales. The government there gave a big tax credit like in a lot of other EU countries to people buying electric cars, so Tesla's sold real well and the german execs were mad.Never understood this loophole either. Can't use a phone while driving but 13 inch touchscreen is allowed?Sudden outbreak of common senseYES! KNOBS WILL BE BACK!It's gotten really annoying. Most drivers aren't even competent enough to be operating a vehicle to begin with. Now we supply them with endless touchscreen distractions that only make things worse.
Not all progress is positive.As they should. Call me grumpy old guy but I would like to see all touchscreens in cars banned.Interesting, but it seems like the court was just ruling on the letter of the law and not out of safety. It didn't matter to the court if using the touchscreen took the same amount of time to press a physical button. They just ruled that since the touchscreen is a "electronic device" as defined by law, it can only be used in the situations allowed by the law. With Volkswagen implementing similar features, I'd guess the law will be modified to allow this kind of use.Finally people seeing sense. I did a project at Jaguat Land rover literally advising them not to replace all physical buttons with touch screens. Obviously they didn't listen as the touch screens are much cheaper.good. Its the dumbest idea ever to out touch screen only into carsGoodGood, now all countries need to follow suit. Car touchscreens and touch controls should not exist.Good. Touch screens in vehicles are fucking stupid.

Sorry it doesn't look cool, but it's way more usable.Infotainment units are absolutely out of control. The only thing the driver should see while driving is their speed, their tach if it’s a manual, their fuel level, odometer, and if there is an engine problem and it’s severity but not the specific problem until they park the car. The entire visual infotainment beyond that should be shut off and disabled while driving.   

I’m good with HUD but dash mounted screens should not be used while driving beyond the most basic needs.Climate controls hidden behind touch screens will always be a dealbreaker to me. During the winter I wear thick gloves and I set the fan speed up + temperature high when I start driving. Then while driving I gradually turn the temperature and fan speed down as the car warms up and windows completely defrost. For this reason I'd rather drive my economy car than something like a brand new Audi A8 for winter driving. 

I'm actually glad I have a lower level trim in my car because it has a [small touchscreen with sizeable shortcut buttons laid out on both sides of the screen](https://www.mupload.nl/img/dpjhu48v.jpg). If I'd taken a higher level trim I would have a bigger screen but I'd also lose out on the shortcut buttons.I drove a Model 3 one time and it was maddening how literally everything was done through that display. Windshield wipers, aircon, even opening the glove boxThose German judges clearly have never used bmw’s I drive system.We have one and it really isn’t as bad as people sayNew S class in shamblesI love Audi mmiHonestly I fucking hate the idea of my car having an iPad in the middleI absolutely hate this development in modern car design, first the radio, then the climate etc. It's downright dangerous, on top of that most of the time it's not even well done, and needs multiple menus just to access basic functions.618 comments and there is a typo in the url that won't resolve...I owned a Model 3 and totally agree with this. I almost swerved off of the road trying to get the A/C blowing in the direction I wanted. I've done the same with the wipers too, because the auto wipers are terrible. I much prefer the control layout in the Model S and this is partly why I sold the M3. What's the point in building such a safe car that, in my real-life experience, is the most dangerous car I've owned due to the controls?!I work in tech but sometimes adding tech just for the sake of tech is actually giving people a worse user experience. I always ask myself the question "This this piece of tech make my life better in some way? Does it make things easier? Faster? Help me remember?" etc.

The problem with an all touch control panel is you have to look at it even momentarily to adjust things. With a physical button you can find a reference and with time adjust everything without looking down ever.and that's exactly why I bought a Mazda, nice screen but you can do everything from the knobs; though screen controls are dangerous road hazardsI guess that means no 10th gen civics. The AC is touch screen controlledDuh.A big thing about touchscreens is that eventually you start having issues with sensitivity, or if the screen goes long enough without being replaced, it downright becomes unresponsive - imagine tapping the screen to go right only for the screen to be frozen & you instead collide with the vehicle in front of you.Thank fuck for that - some authority has finally seen sense. I hate non-essential touch screens on cars. If I have to take my eyes off the road to look where I need to put my finger to turn the heat up, it’s dangerous. Why are these considered allowable but mobile phones aren’t?techbro trends need to not pervade too much into other technologies. especially with cars, where physical, tactile interaction should be favoured, leaving the touchscreen to whatever is necessary for ittouch screen is way worse than controls with any kind of tactile feedback. touch screen demans you divert your eyes from the road. i know their plan is for people to put their lives in the hands of their programming but this is just wrong.That is extremely true. There is no physical buttons which means you have to use features in your car like your hacking some type of computer or something. When you have a screen, it is hard to read when you have the sun shining down as well which creates accidents.  


Land Rover has done the same thing, it is a bad decision like i said i creates accidentsNegative tesla headline? see you all at the top!!Ok, im prepared for the onslaught of downvotes,  but seriously, FUCK Tesla and their entire line of thinking.  I get what theyre trying to do, but running a car company like its Apple is absolutely stupid in the real world. OTA updates that have been known to brick cars, subscription-like features that can and have been arbitrarily removed from the car after delivery, subpar build quality, poor parts and repair availability,  and the aforementioned UI experience are just some of the issues that I have with Tesla. There's something to be said about being "different" but needlessly complicating and changing things thst have worked for DECADES for every other manufacturer is completely stupid.

They're catering to the iPhone crowd that "needs" the latest and greatest feature on the newest and shineyist device. And the Tesla apologists that downplay their problems and flaws are just as bad. You'll ignore the paint, panel fitment, and parts availability flaws. You'll gloss over the fact that they treat the car as if its software, and perpetually want to keep a stranglehold on repar and service to themselves. You'll ignore that people have died due to flaws in their "autopilot" software that cause cars to careen into highway dividers, and you'll scoff at the guy who wrecked his car just trying to turn on the fucking windshield wipers. Yet because its got a slick full touchscreen driver interface, is stupid fast, and is "better for the environment"  its the greatest thing ever. Fuck you and fuck Tesla.




Elon Musk is a chode too......Of all the places we're rolling out voice recognition (I even see bank apps advertising the capability for some reason) why are we not relying on it for some of these functions bafflingly buried in touchscreen menus?

I may be out of the loop, maybe it is, but I am befuddled as to why it takes, in some cars, 2-3 menus to do something as simple as change a radio station or turn your seat heater on. This crap has to stop at some point.I think this is Tesla’s end goal though. To have drivers just play on their giant tablet while being chauffeured to your end destination. Personally not for me.

I think until we get to that state though, where it is full on autonomous driving and you can check out completely, I agree with the court’s ruling. Even the touch screen on my 2019 Golf R is distracting as hell. I would kill to have physical buttons back like in the Mk7.Correct. Touch screens have no place in carsGood. Maybe this will wake up the manufacturers who make every fucking control a touch screen. I don't want to have to navigate 6 menus, then slide my finger across a stupid screen to adjust a simple setting that should be a button or knob. 

infotainment screens in general are so fucking dumb. They're not intuitive and cause more distraction than good.Honestly I feel like touch screens are one of the worst modern automobile features ever created, regarding safety. There is no tactile sense when you’re pushing buttons, so you are required to look at the screen (which is dangerous for obvious reasons). I miss my 1999 mustang that had simple push buttons. Like most people, I just memorized the function and location of each button on my dash so I rarely ever had to look away from the road while I was driving. I feel like we should go back to some version of that.I like the control knob that some manufacturers use. Sure you still have to look at the screen but it's a much quicker glance just to scroll to the correct option rather than having to be looking at the screen while you're reaching out and pressing it to make sure you're pressing on the right place. They also get rid of the issues with touchscreens where if you're driving on a rough road it can be pretty tough to actually press the screen where you're trying to press itWell absolutely. It's not okay to briefly look at your phone, but it's okay to fiddle around in a giant infotainment system and go through multiple menus and submenus to adjust stuff? 

That's nuts.[deleted]It seems a little like rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.

As cars increasingly require less attention and input from humans, distractions are going to become less important.  Then when full self driving comes around, it'll be pointless.


Also, it should be noted that despite having almost *no* physical  buttons, the Model 3 experiences fewer accidents than the average car.  So the government should probably just trust science and rely on the data instead of making knee-jerk decisions.No tactile feedback on touchscreens which means you are either looking at the road or the display. That is like the equivalent of using your phone while driving imo.I’m no more distracted in my Tesla than my Wrangler. The voice control in the Tesla is extremely good and handles most things a knob normally would, like temperature or window selection.

The worst offender in my garage is the Miata, who shuts off the touchscreen over 5MPH and forces you rotate a cursor skipping across random locations on the interface until it reaches the button you want, rather than tapping on the button directly. That paradigm must stop.Good, I can't stand touchscreen crap in a car, I like the tactile feeling of a button because I can find it without looking idk who thought it was a good idea to put tablets in carsIf I ever get a car with a full touch screen for everything... imma just pay to replace that shit

I’m not gonna die in an accident cuz I wanted to switch songFor some reason the page is unavailable.  
It does seem like a lot of car companies are switching to touchscreens and putting form over function.  
But how mant controls do you really need to access while driving?  Besides safety things like wipers and lights, I’d say just ac temp, and maybe volume.[removed]Needs to be voice control of there is a touchscreenLink is broken?Link is broke.I have always wondered how cars get away with this. 
Where I live (Ontario, Canada), my phone is considered a hand held device and I cannot be using it while driving. Fair enough. Enough people die every day, we dont need more. But install a touch screen with almost everything on it my phone has (GPS, music, and all the other car control stuff that comes installed) and that's perfectly OK to fiddle with while driving. How?Touch screens on teslas are probably better than other car manufacturers, just because they can be constantly updated. I have a 2015 subaru, the touchscreen software is a joke, the apps on it are outdated at this point, and just hasnt aged well. I would consider buttons a definite plus for lower tier cars.Is this a bad link for anybody else?

It should be 

https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53666222

but the url has an `l` at the endWhy doesn't Tesla have rain-sensing wipers?  That should be a standard feature if you're spending Tesla money.Loved my Honda Civic Type R for having tactile controls that you didn't ever need to look at to use.haha. Ever see an old person try to use iDrive? That should be considered gross negligence by BMW.All touch screen radios should, bring back my fucking buttonsI have a feeling Tesla will want to get involved and provide this driver with free legal assistance to appeal the decision.100% an awesome idea.I need physical analogue buttons for physical feedback. Do you remember when cellphones had buttons and texting was a physical input instead of a digital one? I could text fine back then but now I can't do it for shit. I feel  the same way when a radio has a volume knob I can twist compared to a digital slider, or digital button that requires my visuals for it's feedback loop. I can't do that shit either. I completely agree we need to go back to having analogue knobs and buttons.My VW has touchscreen controlsof course its from my ducking countryI was given a loaner of a new Outback and it has a big tall screen that takes up the whole center stack with minimal buttons. Thing is so bright and distracting but also you really have to stare at it to figure out what you want to do. 

I guess I am an old man now and agree that big screens in cars like that aren't any different than looking at your phone.trueWebsite dead..

Just judging by the title, it needs to rule Volvo's as well. Where is the line?Thank God. I was delivering a new 308 not too long ago and turning the heater off is far too complicated. Doing it whilst driving would just be dangerous. I don't even see the appeal of infotainment systems anyway. All I need is a Bluetooth connection. Why did screens become popular in cars of all things?Old mobile phone with actual buttons, easily usable by touch... Bottom left button is no 7... pqrs, middle button is 5... Jkl. Easy and quick to learn... Type entire text messages without looking at the buttons or screen once.. 
Touchscreen phones, no way to know what where you are pressing, meaning you have to look at the screen most of the time to know what you're doing. Same with car radios. Actual physical buttons, you can feel/know what buttons you are pressing without taking your eyes off the road. Touchscreen = no way to know what the hell your doing without taking your eyes off the road.I really like Tesla for what they’ve done, but touchscreens are just awful. Buttons, switches and the inclined plane are just superior.I like how no one here reads the articleDistracting electronic device? You mean like AM/FM radio?Fuck touch screensWhat about every GM?You don't have to like touch screens, or automated driving cars, or even electric cars. Just like cowboys didn't like automobiles.What a stupid implementation.  So if the screen goes down you're left with only one wiper speed?  yeah that sounds safe.  /sThe giant touchscreen setup was basically what made me stop looking at Tesla for my next car. Not a fan of touchscreen-only, but I’m okay with it being an option while still having buttons/knobsI hope these touchscreens will be banned. It's like a giant (smart)phone.I have never driven a Tesla. Would someone like to share their experience with its touchscreen controls? I am fairly clumsy, so I imagine that anything besides a chunky manual button or knob would be difficult to use while focusing on the road. But obviously, I don't know.The worst thing for me being a UK driver is I’m being asked to operate these screens with my left hand but I’m really bad with it so more often than not I end up reaching across with my right hand because I just can’t click on the setting I want. 
Love a good knob but side note, I really hate the temperature being measured in actual degrees just show me hot and cold and let me turn the knob somewhere in between please.That's stupid. Loads of card have touchscreens besides Tesla. I feel like this is more targeted at Elon tbh.This is kind of an obvious issue but my guess is tesla is looking past this issue and planning for when their cars are fully autonomous.Thank you!

Fuck touchscreens.

Yeah, ok I get it.  Modern cars have a lot of things to control, but not every single motherfucking thing should be controlled through 10 layers of menus.VW, Benz, and BMW all clapped. 

In all honesty - iDrive is a fucking disaster compared to entering an address on a phone.Ok but if ur car is driving for u then....?Is this based on any safety statistics or just how they feel about it?I have a 12 inch in my 19 RAM. It also has redundant buttons for climate and radio. Love love love the thing. Don't play with the screen outside of quick access stuff while driving though. And when I'm towing, I use the voice commands, "Hey wife, do a thing on the screen". Never had an oh damn, I should pay more attention moment with it.Something that nobody saw coming, yet was so foreseeable.These screens need to be banned in cars, improve safety and full efficiency, the problem with cars wasn't that they didn't have touch screens.They are. I get that touchscreens allow you to load many more features onto the infotainment, but 100% touchscreen is ridiculous. I can’t believe that so many OEMs are going all in. It’s a huge safety hazard and for some insane reason no one is pushing back. Until now I guess.Good. Maybe this'll catch on and this "minimal style" full touchscreen shit will die here and now.Is there any convincing argument that a car benefits from having a touch screen?Not really a hard fix, disable certain functions unless car in park. Or do it like waze where they have to say they are a passenger.Look, I totally get them, people are just throwing away tactile feedback nowadays , screen and touch are great, but I wish the heavy hand of the marked didn't make my car driving experience worseCurious to see how Tesla reacts to this, since their vehicles are designed without the use of buttons in mind.

Also interested to see if Germany (home to many large automotive companies) making this decision will force the recent trend of screens/capacitive 'buttons' across the whole industry to reverse.I prefer actual buttons, especially when you're driving on a bumpy road.Honestly, good.

I hate the touch controls in my car. You can press physical buttons on muscle memory without removing eyes from the road. The touch buttons I have to look at.[removed]Volvo. For a company that emphasizes safety, it's sad the climate controls for their XC90 are touchscreen.Im fine with a little touchscreen map screen and music player. But AC controls shouldn't be touchscreen. I just want to be able to touch a knob without having looking at it while driving.no shit lolTESLA'S ARE NOTHING BUT A GIANT iPAD WITH WHEELS! DON'T TEXT AND DRIVE!it’s not just Tesla it’s the debate about how the „only touchscreens“ cars would disturb you from driving. Using your smartphone while is in most country’s illegal which makes sense so why use your touchscreen for every little thing in your car like seat heater etc. 

I think it’s a very urgent debate before we get even more EV cars on the streets. I personally know a few  people who had minor incidents while test driving a new EV carMy very expensive car has big touchy screen too! It go beep beep and I go vroom vroom!Oh how about Audi’s 2021 models with a big ass touch screen in the middle? Or is it only distracting when it’s on an American car?Tesla is a bit late with touch screens. My 2006 Lexus has a touch screen, lol.[deleted]On my Veloster I can adjust the radio functions and HVAC with either the screen or knobs. The touchscreen is still nice so they can have submenus for other things like to adjust my N settings easily and makes Android auto and Car play work easier as they are both designed around touchscreens. Hyundai actually locks you out of some menus unless the parking brake is engaged. 

I personally think Hyundai found a nice middle ground with touchscreen and physical buttons. Also you can access the owners manual on the infotainment.

None of this is unique to Hyundai specifically but I think it's one of the best approaches.Germany is one of the toughest countries to own a car.I'll take Pathetic counter for NATO removing troops for $100, AlexNot trying to shit on Tesla or any other manufacturers but was there ever a demand against using buttons? 

“God damnit I turning the knob to raise the volume!”  Like did anyone say this?Teslas touch screen isn’t just technology for tech‘s sake, it’s a gimmick to leverage their auto-pilot capabilities. « Sit back and watch get lost in the little tv cuz this baby’s got you » whether it’s that capable is still up for debateThey will probably add a feature to have voice control or some other loop hole.Yeah, no shit sherlock...I don’t see how this is a Tesla only thing. Certain manuf. besides Tesla have distracting car controls too. Obviously not on the scale of needing to look sideways to see your MPH or adjust mirrors but, using a screen to adjust HVAC settings— really?I was really worried about this trend of having a touch screen as the only way to control everything. I don't like to fumble with menus during driving, and having buttons makes it so much easier to change settings and whatnot. You can use your muscle memory without having to take your eyes off of the road.

I hope car manufacturers notice this and stop this childish useless trend. 

Also may I ask an honest question: Why is it now considered "cool" or "high end" to have the gauge cluster (speed, tachometer, fuel gauge, etc.) replaced by a screen?

What happened to having physical gauges? Do you guys remember the speedometer and tachometer in the Audi R8 used to do a full turn when starting the car? Wasn't that awesome? I know they simulate the motion on screens now, but honestly it is not anywhere near as impressive.Oh oh.The whole point of tactile controls is that you can mindlessly use them without taking your attention off the road.Why not voice control options? Like in addition too but can be used as the mainAgreed. I'm happy that my Ram 1500 has knobs that control most features. Meanwhile Teslas have what appears to be 2 iPads welded together, to control all the functions.
