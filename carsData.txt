Garage with garage raccoon: 14/10

Thank you for the suggestionRan over two raccoons on my drive back home from work.  Felt bad earlier, now this thread is making me feel ten times worse. Look at all these fuckin' losers without a garage racoon!> My garage raccoon


wait.... what? Completely unrelated to the tires, but is that raccoon a wild one that somehow got used to you and your garage, or was it already domesticated?I came into this thread looking for answers. 

...But I just have more questions.Hi. Can I have a picture of a garage raccoon? I thought this was all trolling until I saw that OP's account is 6 years old. 

Look through OP's post history and you will find his instagram account, with more adorable raccoon pics. 

OP - thank you for this masterpiece of a thread. Within 9 hours, this has become the top rated post in r/cars. 

TL;DR Cute woodlands creatures may "technically be cheating" but is what we're all here to see anyways.You have a garage raccoon? Admit it op: the only reason you posted this was so you can show off your garage raccoons. > My garage raccoon likes to use my rack of winter tires as a fort. He's usually really good about keeping it clean so I don't check it very often

You fuckin' what now?

e: thanks to a kind user for the gold :)Guy told me today he worked on a car with a pack rat that basically turned the thing into an apartment. He had a bed on one side of the rear in the body work, he had a food stash full of apples, and he had a shitter far away from the rest of it. I guess he reached in and felt something furry and it moved and he ran off screaming. Then he investigated further.


My drive to work is basically 15 miles of farmland and then there's a stop light. Almost every morning I see critters crawling out of cars at that light. Mainly mice. I bet the micdonalds at that intersection has a problem.Well, I don't. I have severe ADHD/hyperfocusing so I basically can only excel at one thing at a time. So for example, the past two weeks I've been working on photos while my house is a mess, no progress on the car, and I've only showered about once every two or three days. Today I'm cleaning the house and will forget the photos because tomorrow I have to hustle for enough money to pay bills for the next month. After about a week or two of that I'll throw all financial responsibility to the wind and either start working on cars or be camped out in the woods with six cameras set up attempting to make a raccoon documentary. Short answer is no it won't. Long answer is urine is water based and contains chemicals that can be found IRL and frequently touches tires, so no it won't.

You may try /r/mechanicadvice next time you have a question.

Edt: /u/striple pointed out that the racoon is peeing INSIDE the tire, not outside, and that urea in high concentrations tends to bust rubber gaskets, so even in the low concentrations in urine, I'm going to say it's not great. A lot of great arguments about acidity and pathogens, but I'm not sure how these would effect rubber without more study.

Also, /u/justalittleaverage had a great method of keeping the wash bear out of the tire, and /u/xhauhst put in an advert for autodetailing. Not sure which sub would be better honestly.OP be careful about avoiding Racoon roundworm. If you catch it you can lose your eyesight and have permanent brain damage. It is fairly common in Racoons in Michigan particularly.

http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,1607,7-153-10370_12150_12220-27261--,00.htmlNo it won't
[deleted][deleted][removed]Coming here from /r/all, first time to /r/cars. What, uh, exactly is this sub about? 

Also, former auto mechanic and tire installer. No, urine will not impact tires.Those are M-Pars aren't they? That's actually hilarious. [deleted]What is going on in this thread??? I'm confused but I love itAlright this is the best thread ever. Jesus I wish I could upvote you into oblivion. I kept scrolling down the thread like what? More pictures.. WHAT! OH MY GOD THIS DUDE IS FOR REAL. So awesome. [removed]No, but it could damage you.  Raccoon urine can carry leptospirosis, a bacteria that can be transmited to humans.  Filling a urine-soaked tire with air and the  letting the air out could aerosolize the bacteria and endanger you and your tire guy.  Wash them down with bleach before you employ the tires. /r/trashpandas will LOVE your garage raccoons. :OShut it down. Reddit is done.

[](#bot)Not near as cool as a garage raccoon, but my uncle once had a garage cat. At one point, he took a road trip a few states away, stopping for gas multiple times and eventually staying in a hotel. Shortly after arriving at the hotel, out from under the car pops garage cat, looking cool and calm as can be.  

He still has no clue how that cat made it all that way, or why it decided to go on an adventure that day. Nonetheless OP, I would make sure you don't pull more Disney-level crap and accidentally take a raccoon and his squirrel friend on an adventure across the country. Unless you really want to. 

Nevermind, do it. Post pics. [deleted]I'm over here in this coffee shop losing it. Tears running down my face. I haven't had this hardy of a laugh from reddit in the longest time. 

*What in the fresh hell is going on?*

Oh my goodness. This is Best Of material right here. I've never seen OP deliver so well.I bought My 4runner from a guy that had a pet raccoon, dude was just a blue collar career carpenter. Half way into buying the rig he asked if I want to see something cool, opened his door, called out and out walks these little dude scampering around. It was dope I got a good deal on my rig and got to play with a pet trash panda CHECK OP'S HISTORY.

How are they doing today?? This is now my favorite thread on Reddit, your garage raccoons are just tooooo darned adorable!!!!!Can I know more about the raccoon?

I don't think small quantities of urine will hurt the tires, just spray them down a bit now and again.Best. Thread. Ever. I gotta thank you for posting all your raccoon pictures, it totally made my day. Best op ever.My life has been forever altered by this post. Nothing can ever be the same. Today i am a new manAre you married? If not, can I marry you and become the raccoon queen?I really want to know now if pee will damage tires, and all I see are racoons!Wow. You literally have pet raccoons. 

Maybe I'm just tired and this thread is telling me it's time for bed....This is going on r/bestof We need a amaThis is one of the funniest threads I've ever come across[removed]Welp, this is the best thread /r/cars will get this month. Pack it up, gentlemen, I'll see you all in 30 days.I have no idea what the fuck is going on here but I love it.Typically the diesel nozzle is much larger than the gasoline nozzle and you can't fit it into your car, but I have seen diesel nozzles the "smaller" size. 

Other posters have stated what to do, call a tow truck and take 'er to a good shop or take it home and drain the gas tank yourself. Majorly screwed something up. 

Noticed immediately. 

Did not exacerbate the problem.

Got help immediately. 

Recognized that there wasn't actually a problem. 

Admitted the mistake with humor. 

You're gonna go far, kid. [deleted][deleted]How? the Diesel nozzle end is too big to fit into an unleaded filler tube. Did you like, hold it there spraying diesel everywhere?Found the Oregonian.get it towed to a shop; if you havent run it all you need to worry about is having the tank drained. if you ran it you are fucked and will have to have the injectors cleaned as well as the fuel lines etc Mate and I were going out of town late one night and filled up. Left the service station and got about a kilometer up the road when the car started to run roughly and lose power. So much so that it would only move at just above idle. As soon as we tried to accelerate it would die.

We decided to go back and get another car. About a kilometer past the service station we noticed a car on the side of the road with the bonnet up and remembered that he was filling up the same time we were. We stopped and sure enough he had the same problem. He had filled his tank and the car wouldn't run at all, we had just topped up so we knew it must be a fuel problem. 

So he and his passenger jumped in our car and we headed back to the servo. The kid working there had no idea what to do when confronted by two lots of pissed off customers. We got him to turn on the pump and found it was diesel instead of regular petrol. He said that the tanker had just been there before we had both filled up and must have filled the wrong tank.

He rang the owner but got no response so he was all out of ideas.  By this stage it was about two in the morning and we didn't want to hang around any longer. We found a drum and were able to drain our tank and refill with super. We demanded our money back as well for our trouble. Went on our way without further problem. 

No idea what happened with the other customer but he wasn't happy.

This was a car with a carburetor, no idea how an injection system would cope but don't see any reason it would react differently. DO NOT START THE ENGINE.

Get the car towed and have the gas tank drained. If you didn't start it that's all you'll need to have done. The second you turn that key things will get much, much worse.[deleted][deleted]FYI Diesel nozzles are different sized from petrol.  You would have to be trying really hard to fill up with diesel.  > Things like this leave me to believe I won't make it far in life

"Not getting far in life" isn't a result of making a mistake. It's the result of making the same mistake twice. Just make sure to pay more attention next time.You're the man.  Two dumbass moments that canceled each other out.  Plus learning, and admitting mistakes?  Damn, son, you're going far with that attitude.Upvoted because this is totally something that I would do. Glad you didn't actually fill it with diesel.My dad used to be a fuel delivery driver for a chain of truck stops that were local to our state. Ever see the tank lids in the ground at gas stations? They usually [look like this](http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wnpr/files/styles/medium/public/201503/underground_gas_tank.jpg), including the colors. The different colors differentiate the tanks so the right fuel ends up in the right place. Once upon a time he delivered to a stop not usually on his route that hadn't repainted the tank lids in years and couldn't identify one from the other. He even asked the station management and they couldn't tell him for some reason. 

Picked one, and happened to pick the wrong one. Diesel filled the underground Unleaded tank, then into cars without the owners having any idea.

Needless to say the chain paid out some damages, fixed the tank markings, and of course fired my dad.lmao seems you realized you were good quick enough. Enjoy life while you are youngDude how high are you right now?You may think you get magical adult knowledge, but you don't. These kinds of things won't stop, ever. You just get better at dealing with and hiding them.This thread has really taken off. We'd like to remind everyone to be civil to one another. If you think someone has gone too far, please report it to the mods and we'll look into it.[deleted]I accidentally put 5 liters of diesel in my car at an old gas station when I was on a road trip; I was tired and didn't notice until I got a whiff of diesel. I tried siphoning, but I quickly found out that my car has an anti-siphoning device. I spent the next hour researching and doing maths to figure out how/what I could do to not fuck up my engine. What I ended up doing was filling my tank up with premium, and then topping up with more premium every 100 kilometers or so. My car was still running 600 kilometers later, at that point I ran the car until it was nearly empty and pretended I hadn't put diesel in my car in the first place.

I know you didn't actually put diesel in your car, but if you're ever in that unfortunate situation, there are still ways to not screw up your car. Definitely save the diesel. It’s worth more than your carFor future reference, if it's just a little bit in an older vehicle it's not the end of the world. Just put as high of an octane gas as you can in and you should be fine.

If you put more than a few gallons in or it's a newer vehicle, have it towed to a shop and have the tank drained. I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

Heck, my Chevy Duramax 6.6L V-8 turbo-diesel gets 15.3 mpg and only cost $64,996. I’ll never make the mistake of putting diesel in a gas tank again after paying that much. I only bought it so I could tell my friends they only ask for my help moving because I own a truck and because I thought the guy who sold it to me was kinda cute. We exchanged numbers and I told him about how I can’t read and he said he moonlights as an English teacher. One thing led to another and after a night of passionate love/pegging in the back of my fully loaded crew cab, I convinced him to buy a truck just like mine. Who’s the salesman now, dad? ARE YOU PROUD OF NOW ME DAD?I used to work at a Honda Dealership back in the late 90's before the different size nozzles and this happened probably once a month... Most didn't realize it until their car shut down a few blocks away and then had it towed... as soon as they said they got gas and then it died we would open the gas door and that diesel smell was obvious... drop the tank, Drain it, clear the lines, Pull the plugs and clean at the least.. It was $400 plus back then and labor rates were only $65 an hour in those daysHoly shit I had a 2000 Pontiac sunfire too. Loved that girl[deleted]this will go down in the reddit post hall of fame[deleted]Hey bud, late to the party but I used to work in fuels so thought I would chime in to give you information just in case you find yourself in a similar situation in the future.

I don't know what the price per gallon is in your area, and I don't know the capacity of your tank.

First, you'd want to try and siphon out as much of the diesel as you can. You can usually get these manual pump things at an autoparts store. They don't work great though. I prefer getting hose and doing it the old fashioned way.

After you've gotten as much of the diesel out as you can, you just fill it up with gasoline and you're good to go.

Now, if 7 bucks is only a few gallons in your area, like it is in mine, you'd just be able to put gasoline in with the diesel and the gasoline would essentially "Overpower" the diesel.

The car has the potential to be a little sputtery as it burns through the diesel/gas mixture, but it wont actually cause any damage to the vehicle.Lol! This is the cutest thread I’ve seen all day. 

Thanks for the laugh! We all make mistakes but at the end of the day thank your dealer for that boom ass chronic he gave you People have been pretty brutal to you. Remember that mistakes are life’s teachers. This was an honest mistake, you’re not stupid for not knowing what diesel was, but you know what? I bet you will never forget. Take the comments with a grain of salt, and don’t be so hard on yourself. You’re only 17. I thought I had it all figured out back then, and I have been taught many many many times since then that I didn’t. Hey dude, just wanted to let you know: don't worry. We all make stupid mistakes sometimes and especially so when we panick - and being young increases the chances of panicking (the whole life experience thing) so don't overthink this incident, don't let it make you feel stupid or bad. Roll with it, laugh about it, we all do this shit at some point. Maybe not diesel/gas - but look, I lost my mom before she could teach me cooking. So I had to teach myself. In my unerring love for all things garlic, I made a whole lot of recipes involving garlic. You may ask yourself: well what's the fuckup there?

The fuckup is when you mistake garlic bulbs/heads for garlic cloves/toes and instead of adding two garlic cloves/toes as the recipe calls for, you add two entire frigging bulbs/heads instead. And you end up loving it. And you think it's supposed to be like this. And then you continue for about half a year until you live in a student dorm. And you serve your favorite dish (with a loooooot of garlic) and share it with your dorm mates. 

That's when you realize: you've been an idiot for six months and not everyone loves garlic as much as you do ;)

Hope this cheered you up some! 

Things like this leave me to believe I won't make it far in life.
same.The only suggestion I have for you is try a bit of Mindfulness. It's tough being in the present at your age, but learning how to be, on demand, is worth a lot as your life goes on.Give yourself a break. I did stuff like this as a teenager. We’ve all been there. the fact that you're being humble about it shows that you actually will make it far in life, so chin up dudeDon't beat yourself up bud, you had the good instinct not to start the car until you knew it was safe. That could have saved you a costly repair. Being prudent will always pay off, even if it was for nothing, you didn't worsen your situation.When I got my first car at 17 I didn't realize you needed to change your oil. I literally never changed the oil. Never put oil in it. Never even thought about it. I fucked my engine up big time. Had to trade the car in for parts. I felt like a fucking dumbass. Overall, shit happens. You live and you learn. At least you were able to recognize it. I like this post. This post made my day.Are you perhaps an Oregon resident?Don't feel bad; it could have been worse. You could have been [this guy](http://www.gixxer.com/forums/27-anything-goes/226570-bike-wont-start-after-using-nos-fuel-additive.html).Don't be too hard on yourself, you'll do some much stupider shit later in life and look at this back and say that was funnyHey, don't stress. Everybody fucks up sometimes. I saw your update, but even if you had managed to fill it with diesel at least you had the sense not to drive it and to ask for help.When I switched from diesel car to petrol car, I almost did it.. I remember holding a diesel gun, staring at the car for a while and think: do I miss something?Everyone makes mistakes and gets confused at times. Don’t be so hard on yourself bro. Exact opposite. This level of self awareness and willingness to admit mistakes will take you far in life.Better to look a fool, than to be a fool. You did the right thing seeking help rather than taking your chances.

Glad you didn't have diesel in your tank :-)'I'm seventeen and relatively new to driving my own car'      

can confirm that im eighteen and am depressed of not having my own car
I think everyone fucks up once in their lives.

I used to work at a campground/Festival grounds where we had gas golfcarts to get around on. Well this new guy started, much older than I but dumb as a doorknob. But he did know a few things here and there. Never did I think he would mix gas and diesel. 

So one day he comes up to me telling me his cart isn't working well. I get in and hit the go pedal and it goes ten feet or so and stops. Goes ten feet stops. So I say fuck it we'll look at it later, big boss man needs help with something. So big boss man is on the front end loader and says we need to fuel up first. We had our own above ground fueling tanks. One for gas and one for diesel. 

We get to the fueling stations and new guy goes and grabs the gas nozzle clearly labeled gas and in the red tank (Diesel was in a white or yellow tank marked diesel) and almost puts it into the loader when boss man  catches him and ask what the fuck he was doing "THAT'S GAS" he yelled. New guy goes to put the gas nozzle back when I look over and ask if he read the signs. It was right then you could see the gears turning in his head and he goes ^oh ^OH OHHHH NOOOOO! OH SHIT SHIT SHIT!. 

He put diesel in the gas golf cart and just now realized why it didn't work right. 

No big deal though we just used a pump to empty the tank, fill it with gas and it worked fine for the rest of my time there.

As for myself I once went to put a quart of oil in my girlfriend's car and grabbed a quart of power steering fluid instead because same color and sized bottle. Put the whole thing in her oil tank and started the car and got down the road before I  realized.  Ran downtown in my car and got new oil and changed her oil before letting her go anywhere.For future reference the diesel nozzle doesn’t fit in the gas hole to fill up your tank...You'll find that you learn lessons really, really well when it is embarrassing. Some people will end up with 3 or 4 stories where they very nearly tried to gas up with diesel. The OP will have exactly 1 story of the same.
Embarrassment is a terrific teacher.

Also, hello visitors from /all. Please take a moment to review our rules found here: www.reddit.com/r/cars/about/rulesI mean fuck, you are already making him drive 6 hours with a truck full of birds.  I'd recommend smoking a brisket on the way as well to de-escalate the situation.If you MUST dehydrated them see if you can drop it off at a friend or relatives house near by. They can babysit the tomatoes. Just tell them when to turn it off. Have it completely ready just needs to be plugged in.NGL, I lost it when the parrot came into the picture lol.Mods, please pin this because I feel like a lot of people will be looking for this solution as well.This is over *three dollars* ($3), correct?It’s a 3$ case of tomatoes.... fertilize the soil with them (if you’re living in warm weather), or freeze them. Dehydrate another dayA **serious** answer from someone who has done car detailing for many of my youthful years.

It will likely leave an odor for a few days but nothing permanent. Tomatoes don't really have a powerful smell like garlic or onions. And if for some reason dehydrating exacerbates the issue (which i would guess it would actually weaken the smell) just buy a can of Oziom car spray or any other auto "scent bomb", and that will eliminate the scent pretty well.Yo I don't have the answer to your questions, but I just wanna say, this is the best question I've seen posted here since I started paying attention to this subreddit.

EDIT* [I made a commemorative poster.](https://i.imgur.com/hLCSDTT.jpg)[deleted]I think you already know in your gut. He will not divorce you, but this is an unreasonable request and he shouldn’t have to be put in this position. Either ask someone to care for your tomatoes or ditch them. $3. Three dollars.A lot of the answers here are making fun of this question, but please please please DO NOT do this. I have known 12 people who have passed away from thinking they could dehydrate their tomatoes while driving. It’s an issue that is becoming increasingly more common and I have been trying to raise awareness for it, please do not become another statistic. 

I understand it is easy to impulse buy things like this, but it is important to know that tomatoes will take your life in an instant if they get the chance. It was a big purchase but your life is worth more, trust me.I feel like this is a problem out of my grade school textbook. Is this real?Your question just begs more questions.I'd say do it but parrots are very sensitive to air quality, to the point where you can't even use standard non-stick pans around them.Is your marriage worth to you more than $3?I'd divorce you for trying to make me eat dehydrated tomatoes, regardless of where you dehydrated them tbqhPeak r/cars. Pack it up we're done hereSounds like there's enough going on in your lives to bother with dehydrating $3 of tomatoes on top of it.

I would wait for things to return to normal and dehydrate tomatoes when the dust has settled.[deleted]I don’t know if this is truly serious but here’s a serious answer:

Pre-2021 F-150s have inverters rated for 400w.  I googled the power usage of dehydrators and the answer was 300-1000w.  If yours is more than 400w then no you can’t (and if it’s less than 400w but your blower motor isn’t great then it may not work either).Parrot- tomatoes! tomatoes!

Husband- \*sighs\* Jesus Christ.Yes. And you are going to lose the parrot in the custody hearing.[deleted]I desperately want to know the answer to this as wellPractically you have to check the wattage of the inverter and the wattage of the dehydrator. Anything that makes heat uses a lot of watts. If your daughter did not specifically request dehydrated tomatoes do not do it. There are few things as emotionally charged as a man's (or sometimes a woman's) truck. There's that saying "A(wo)man and her/his truck, it's a beautiful thing" so no offense but he might divorce you, even if he drives a less expensive truck like a Chevy s-10. Trucks are just so practical that there's always something to love. Like a man who cooks. Being a flock mate to the parrot, imo not so much. Depending on what your husband thinks of the parrot, you might just find yourself renewing your vows if the parrot gets poisoned by tomato fumes. Your final resort might be too say, can I dehydrate these tomatoes in your truck. I won't complain a single bit if it kills the parrot. Like canaries in a coal mine, parrots are extraordinarily sensitive to air contamination, so it's not outside the realm of possibility that the parrot keels over.  Who's going to eat the tomatoes anyway? I apologize if I did not get the joke, but I doubt anything could be better than what she said.At this point you want to urgently buy your own dehydration truck. The longest loan the better, the higher the percentage the better. Higher numbers are vastly superior. Don’t do anything under a 7year loan at 20%. This is common knowledge on this forum.

This way your husband can keep his truck free of stuff, and your daughter can give birth in the back of your truck helped by the delicious and relaxing scent of tomatoes.

Make sure the new truck’s color matches the parrot however, or this is moot.Your willing to take the chance of annoying or "smelling up" your husband's truck for $3 ?Tomatoes fuming

Grandchild about to pop

Parrot says it overParrot will act as a canary in the coal mine.This sounds like more of an r/relationship_advice question instead of r/cars :DYes, it’s an automatic divorce. Because of the parrot not the tomatoes.Does the rear window open? Run an extension from the interior, out the window to the bed? Although, then I feel like you might have a parrot issue.you had me at "impulse bought"There is a parrot involved?I love me a good shit post, and this is one of my favorites so far.You'd be better off just tossing the tomatoes or finding another use for them. If you attempt this and there is a lingering smell, it'll cost way more to have a detailer run an ozone generator to remove the smell. If there is a situation on the road that requires a sudden maneuver and the tomatoes spill out, it's going to cost hundreds to have the interior cleaned to remove the stains on top of having the ozone generator ran.

What I'm saying is you're running a high risk of spending a *lot* of money to justify not wasting $3. Maybe try one of those plug-in timer things that automatically shuts off after a set amount of time. That way you can leave the tomaotes dehydrating at home and have the dehydrator turn off around the time they would be done. But whatever you do, don't bring that into his truck lol.Just wait till the baby comes, what's so critical about these tomatoes?It's a 3$ case of tomatoes, certainly not worth risking mood ruination on a very important day for your family IMO. I would ask him what he thinks about it and go from there. If you had more time maybe you could test it by leaving a towel next to the vent and see if it picks up the smell for an extended period of time. For this to be a proper experiment you can only do to the towel what you're willing to do to the interior of the truck.Should be fine.

This comes down to if you like the smell of tomatoes or not, possibly for a short while. Personally, I would be down for this!

In the way of long term smells, won't/shouldn't be any. You might be surprised at the things that get pulled out of a car during a detail or trade-in process. Almost all smells come out with a simple cleaning and the more difficult ones you ozone the cabin.

Smoke (think cigarette), or worse, are different. Smoke permeates due to the chemicals and how they bond with the AC vents and other petroleum based products in the vehicle, like plastics and ducts. You are essentially laying down a thin layer of a chemical varnish when smoking that you have to manually remove with direct chemical application. Can't do that in vents!

**Plus, you get to nickname the truck Mater!**This thread is giving me vivid Car Talk nostalgia.Jesus, my life is so boring.I love that your parrot is such an integral part of the family that it obviously have to be there when your daughter gives birth.You need to honey. Where else are you going to find tomatoes? This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. If he doesn't let you, then leave him.No idea but please let us know the final results (both your tomatoes, truck, and your marriage)I’ve dehydrated French fries in all of my cars. No ill effects

And congrats BTWThe year is 2050 , little Jimmy's grandfather is putting him to sleep with the tale of the great tomato crisis of 2021.

"Jimmy",his grandfather said "2021 was supposed to be a year of hope , a year where people thought things were finally going to return back to normal,no more being stuck inside ,no more of staring at screens all day, no more living in a constant fear of catching a deadly disease or worse seeing your co-worker half naked in his undies. Things started out good too, we had a new not crazy president, vaccines were being administered and in general there was hope but things soon changed for the worse , people stormed the Capitol , Texas got covered in snow and Myanmar had a coup.But the most worrying thing of all was the great tomato crisis of u/ductoid ,for she was faced with the dilemma of whether or not to dehydrate her $3 worth of tomatoes in her husband's truck risking it smelling like an Italian Nona's sauce cupboard and a possible divorce from ruining his beloved ford-f150.Things were further  complicated by a particularly emotionally clingy parrot,whom they had to take with them in the truck and her daughter who was going to be giving birth at any second and was the reason why u/ductoid was thinking of dehydrating her tomatoes in the truck on the long drive to their daughter place.

u/ductoid presented her dilemma infront of a forum of virgins and weebs.Answers came in from far and wide.Some where useful ,some not but most just made fun of her,for what kind of a woman would risk her marriage for $3 worth of tomatoes.But for u/ductoid it was a matter of principle.So,she finally decided to go ahead with her plan.As her daughter's water broke she and her husband rushed to the truck,loaded up their parrot and the dehydrator with the tomatoes inside them.

The first couple of hours were pretty uneventful.The parrot was doing whatever parrots do and the dehydrator was working without a hitch,its constant low pitch hum being almost soothing.u/ductoid and her husband though excited , were also reminiscent of all the fun and romantic memories they had on long trips like these both as a family and a couple but little did they know that this was the calm before the storm.

As hour 4 of the unforgettable 6 rolled around ,u/ductoid suddenly heard the parrot squeak ,"Mel,where are you ??".Who Mel was is a story for another time but all you need to know was he was the parrot's previous owner and had since passed away.
Startled by the noise ,u/ductoid waking up from her nap looked in the back seat and what she saw shook her to the core.The bird cage's door had come undone and the parrot had managed to get one of the tomato loaded trays out of the machine.As she watched on,like a car crash happening in slow motion,frozen by the realisation of her worst fears coming true,the parrot's sharp claws crushed a tomato, sending it's juices flying all over the seats.u/ductoid lurched to get the remaining tomatoes out of the parrot's reach but alas she slipped on the slick tomato juice covered seats and sent the entire load of her dehydrator flying.As her husband watched on in silence from the driver seat not able to take his eyes of the road all he could make out was the smell of tomatoes that had filled the entire interior of the truck.Meanwhile in the back seat there was a war raging on. Millions of years human evolution against one extremely emotionally compromised parrot who was intent on making his dinosaur ancestors proud.There battle was one of epic proportions,u/ductoid  saving as many of her precious tomatoes as she could,displaying athletic abilities which only come from raising kids while the parrot was busy committing tomato war crimes, crushing and gnawing at their plum red skins   making crimson streaks of tomato juice flying anywhere and everywhere and simultaneously chanting it's maniacal warcry of ,"Mel,where are you?".The battle between the allied powers of u/ductoid and the axis powers of avian tomato genocide continued for the rest of the journey.As the husband parked his truck in the driveway and finally looked at  the back seat ,he couldn't eve muster a single word.The scene that met his eyes would make even the most stone cold man cry.The parrot was passed out in its bird cage with its door wide open.On the other end of the seats was u/ductoid,his beloved wife of many years with a look of despair in her eyes for she could save none but only three of her precious tomatoes.As the husband looked on all that met his eyes was how much of his leather interior was covered in drying sticky tomato juice.As two painfull drops of tears rolled down each of his cheeks all he could say was ,"u/ductoid just promise me,you will never again even think of dehydrating anything."

As grandpa ended his story he noticed Jimmy was fast asleep and all he heard was a voice from downstairs squawking,"Mel,where are you?".I usually dehydrate mine by stuffing them in the exhaust pipe[removed]Did you option the truck with the dehydration package? Pairs well with the air fryer package. Honestly can't drive a F-150 without it.Serious Ken M vibes here.I feel like I just got a sneak preview to the Ford F-150 2022 Superbowl Ad.You’ve got a complicated life.what the fuckYou could technically run an extension out back window, tie the dehydrator with bungee cords to secure it and leave it out during the drive.

Alternatively, consider getting a tonneau cover, power was the bed, get cling wrap/a sheet of metal/parchment to cover the bed, then lay the tomatoes down and sprinkle olive oil + salt. Assuming you live in a relatively warm and dry area, the heat absorbed by the bed might be hot enough to dehydrate the tomatoes and make them sun dried. 

Recipe here [Homemade Sun-dried Tomatoes](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/oven-sun-dried-tomatoes/)

The recipe says it takes about 2.5hours. Your 6hour drive is more then sufficient.You have a literal canary in the metaphorical coal mine, I think you're set lol.For the safety of the birds absolutely not. It will kill them. They dont have lungs like we do that can filter shit. They have (depending on the species) about 9 air sacs and they have zero ability to filter fumes. In fact you shouldn’t have candles, teflon pots/pans, or anything that can aerosolize in your home as youd be significantly be affecting their health. You wouldn’t even know it unless they died since they hide illness ridiculously well.I love this question, especially the parrot part.[I think you have a strong opportunity to expand your manifold recipes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine_cooking)

It's your manifold destiny.Forget the god damned tomato’s they were $3Why would you go through all this trouble for 3 dollars worth of tomatoesJust run an extension cable out the back window to the bed. Problem solved.Asking the real questionsJust put a sheet of cookies to bake on the dash to offset the smell.A vast amount of people are allergic to tomatoes so please make sure to run the air circulation setting so those outside aren't killed by your tomato air.I’d personally just take the tomatoes as a 3 dollar loss. The grief from the 3 bucks is not worth it.  If my mother in law did this to her husbands truck, it wouldn’t even get plugged in, I think he’d drop her in the drive way with a gun. Don’t come between a man and his truck. They’re hard to separate.I think the more important question is whould the parrot divorce you for dehydrating tomatoes in the same car...NTA. He's lucky he married you and should back up every crazy scheme you have. If not find a man that will let you dehydrate tomatoes in his pickup.As a bird owner, it will 100% kill your parrot, they have super sensitive noses and any kind of fumes can kill them, please do not murder your bird.In high school someone pranked me by pouring tomato sauce on my windscreen.  It got into the AC intake and my car smelled like funky tomato forever.

You should definitely dehydrate tomatos in your husbands truck.I'm surprised anyone who owns a bird is concerned with the cleanliness or smell of a given area they put said bird into.Now THIS is the ideal use case for a F-150.I feel like this post is making the "use the search function" people cry...Your husband should be impressed, if anything. Tomatoes dehydration is exactly the level of work that the 150 is designed for.You could just use a smart plug at home (a pack of them are like $15–20 or so on Amazon, usually) and turn it off remotely or set a timer in the Smart Things app - that's my go-to for dehydrating shit if I know I have errands or potential interruptions that'll take me away from the house.

Or, you know, a timer people use for Christmas lights and lamps when they're on vacation that you can get at Target.Decided to follow this subreddit after reading this post. I need answers to questions like these.I love when a random, less front-pagey sub gets such a fantastically bizarre post that they make the front page.I feel like I'm in r/subredditsimulator right now.If it were jerky this would be a much easier answerThis is a perfect opportunity to upsell your husband on getting an E class Mercedes or higher. As these vehicles all come built-in with a Mercedes perfume system, meaning you can dehydrate and hotbox as many tomatoes as you want without leaving an odor. This is the galaxy brain move.Please be careful dehydrating tomatoes. Some variety’s will actually hatch since the dehydrator acts as an incubator. Roma’s and beefsteaks produce the worst offspring. Skip the dehydrator and since the truck is available do what I do when I dry upwards of 7 bushels. You’ll only need kabob skewers. Skewer all tomatoes on the sticks an place in the engine compartment of the truck. Don’t worry they’ll all fit once you slam the hood. It takes approx 6 hours to dry so you’re good to go there. I don’t know much about parrots, I’m a tomato guy.You seem to have one hell of a family going on and I want inYou could try skunk spray to get rid of the tomato smell? It makes sense because tomato juice reduces skunk spray smell so the inverse should work.People out here acting surprised, but I could see my wife doing exactly this. She would say:

"Would it be weird if I deyhdrated these tomatoes on our road trip?" 

And I'd have to be like, "No it's fine" because I take great comfort in knowing that I don't ever need to waste money on expensive jewelry knowing that it wouldn't make her as happy as that $3 pallet of tomatoes alongside all of the dreams/aspirations that accompany it.

Let us know how they turn out!It's doable. Fresh air would come in while you drive from the AC. The smell will linger in the car for a bit, but most likely won't remain for too long. Can't give a definite timeline, but I doubt it will last any longer than a month. Plus, you can always Ozone treat it and it'll go away. As long as it's not smoke / cigarettes, the smell won't stay.$3 of tomatoes vs ruining the cabin of a vehicle your husband has to dive in for im assuming his livelihood. Depends entirely on how good your husband is to you, but if he aint treating you right.... I say dehydrate those tomatoes babygirl.If the back window can open why not strap it in the bed and run the power cable into the cab? No fumes are good for birds. Some are too sensitive for simple candles.You can do this if you have more than 200,000 miles on the truck.Wot in Betty CrockerJust eat the tomatoes. They're delicious and nutritious.I would be less than pleased if it left a lingering scent. You could mitigate it by leaving the windows open and worst case a thorough cleaning of any carpet/upholstery will help get rid of it. An activated charcoal bag absorbs scents to a certain degree and an ozone generator can be used as a last resort.


But the real question is it worth it to risk the lingering scent and have to go through the expense or trouble of getting rid of it for $3 of tomatoes?Let’s start a GoFundMe to help cover OP’s tomato costsI ran my dehydrator for 4 weeks in a row without issue so you should be able to set it and forget it at home and not worry about the tomato smell.$3? Depends how you would evaluate the financial aspect of the marriage LOL.Based on my mother in law’s cars, regardless of the tomatoes, the car will never smell right again after the bird rides in it for 6 hours.  Those things are NASTYIf you think ‘murder’ is ‘divorce’ then yeahWhat is this top tier shitpost lmao. Good job OPIf he didn't divorce you over the parrot, he won't for this. 

I say do it, only so your husband can tell this story for years about how ridiculous y'all are.Why don't you just get an outlet timer to shut off the dehydrator after you have left. Like those ones for Christmas lights.This is a classic Car Talk question, I can imagine the brothers just cracking up in my head.Is this real life?First of all what the fuckCan you return the tomatoes? Just claim they’re defectiveHalf the people in this thread: -.-

The other half: “We don’t need sleep, we need answers!”This whole thread is like a fever dream.It’s an F150. Might improve the vehicle. :)How many outlets could the doctors need at the hospital? Just load your daughter and the docs up in the F-150 and by the time the baby’s out, you’ll be back at home to enjoy your freshly dehydrated tomatoes.Dehydrate the husband instead, you'll get a better flavorNo, the dehydrator really just removes pure water. If there is a little tomato smell I think it would dissipate rapidly. Anyway, if the parrot keels over just bail out of the truck. 🦜Neat. Let's see that get enforced now. I think last year, they said that they would start enforcing the Keep Right unless passing rule out here in Michigan. Never happened. There are still many people who drive on the left lane and cruising. So it is now illegal in Nevada to drive below and above the speed limit.~~Fast Lane~~ **Passing Lane**
[deleted][deleted]LOL, so as far as the law is concerned you have to drive the EXACT speed limit, or be fined.  Our traffic laws in this country are so idioticSo, nevada has effectively made driving in the fast lane illegal, since you can never be at exactly the speed limit.lol won't change anything.



in Texas there a TONS of signs that say "Left lane for passing only" and there is always a jackass who only drives in the left lane. Illegal to drive over and under the speed limit. 

Cops can fuck you lane is now open!!So it's now illegal to speed and, if you're in the left lane, illegal not to speed? Where's the sense here?"STOP FLASHING YOUR LIGHTS! I'M GOING EXACTLY THE SPEED LIMIT" Yeah. Not a fan of this. Just get undercover cars and pull over cars that have a convoy behind them and refuse to move over when they have a gap.i blame poor driving education. guess people figure if road etiquette isn't mandatory then they have a right to drive like a dick.

carpooled with a guy who insisted left lane was just another lane, there shouldn't be cars driving faster than us, and cars could just go around him. so fucking embarrassing riding with him. homeboy never made the connection that we'd get honked at and flipped off exclusively when he drove.I live in Las Vegas so I'll chime in. I believe there have been 13 citations.

It's not encouraging speeding it's mainly to keep the passing lane open. It's been a nice change, but overall I still see a lot of slow cars in the left lane on my daily commute. I think one problem people are having is with the wording and how the left lane has been described.  We need to stop calling it the "Fast Lane" because anybody going over the speed limit thinks they are going fast and therefor are justified in using it.

CALL IT THE PASSING LANE to everybody you might talk about this to.  Hopefully over time, probably not, the conception will change and people will get into it to pass and get the fuck back over.

Also people sitting in the middle lane and not getting over in the right lane helps cause this.  Another common thing I've heard is that lane changing is dangerous so people try and not do it.  It's only dangerous if you don't look when you lane change and check all of your blind spots.  Say I'm going over the speed limit in the right hand lane passing a line of 5+ cars in the middle lane and then there's a guy coming up behind me another 5+ mph difference.  I'd love to be able to jump into the middle lane and let him by but more than likely there's no space between the line of cars in the middle lane.... and the fucking right lane is EMPTY.  Because of this I use the right lane a lot I find to pass cars.Can someone explain what the fuck a speed limit is thenThere's always that left lane Prius that makes you and everyone else late for work in the morning. 

I'd love for this to come to NY. Unfortunately, this would never be enforced. Its not the speed **limit** anymore, it's now just the 'speed'?This law doesn't make sense.

Vehicle speeds always vary, it's fairly rare to stay at EXACTLY the same speed for an extended period of time. 

So

It's now illegal to drive under the speed limit in the left lane 

AND

It's illegal to drive over this speed limit in the left lane

So you can ONLY drive in the left lane if you are going the EXACT speed limit.

Obviously it won't be enforced this strictly but it's still stupidFlorida recently did this also. It's funny when you see a police officer going down the fast lane turning on his lights and forcing all of the slow drivers to move over and then going on to the next one over and over and over again.Cop: "With probability 1, you were driving an illegal speed."

Driver: "Which offense is it?"

Cop: "Not sure. Radar said 70. Standard deviation is 3 mph."

Driver: "Doesn't that mean that there was a 23.6 percent chance I was in [69.5, 70.5), which would round to 70?"

Cop: "It does, but even in that interval, the point {70} has measure zero."

Driver: "Well, fuck. Hey, who says the mile has an exact definition?"

Cop: "5280 times 0.3048 meters, obviously."

Driver: "Right, but the meter depends on the second, which depends on..."

Cop: "I've got a Cesium-133 atom right here, buddy."

Driver: "..."If I remember correctly the 405/5 merge in Irvine, CA is near 20 lanes across.  Still you see people go all the way to the left, then slow down.  I am all for enforcing this law.  Think of all the lane changes a slow driver causes.Wait so now its just technically illegal to ever driver in the fast lane?

Speed limit = go faster than it and its illegal. Now go slower than it and it is illegal. So you have to be going exactly, say, 60 mph or you cnlan be ticketed.

Makes no sense to have the law written like that. Realistically you arent judging your own speed that accurately...


 If we want to set a minimum speed we should just do it and get rid of this "The speed limit is the speed you MUST ALWAYS GO!!" when legally it is the maximum speed.

If you have a 60mph road, go ahead and legally set a minim speed of 55mph for the fast lane. Or 60mph and raise the limit to 65.

But don't set the speed minimum equal to the speed limit. That's just foolish.

And if somebody here chimes back "You aren't going to get pulled over until 10 over". Then fine. Make thwt the actual stated limit. Gray zones and nonobvious limits are dumb.

Make it clear black and white on the sign. "Speed maximum 70mph. Speed minimum 60mph". Then write the law that you can be subject to fines of 100 / 250 / 1000 for (rounded up) increments of 5mph outside this (or whatever numbers make sense). 

And please put a "Weather permitting" note directly into the law... Encouraging in any way people to drive fast if it is raining hard o foggy or something is foolish.So if they can't go below the speed limit, they must either go exactly the speed limit or faster (which is also a crime) seems like a trap to me.Fuck. This needs to go nation wideWhat about rush hour?God I hope California follows next...so irritating when someone is oblivious in the fast lane with a line of cars behind them.I've always thought that speed limit laws were fucking stupid. Technically speaking if you're going 66 in a 65 zone, you are speeding and a police officer having a particularly bad day CAN stop you and ticket you and they would be correct in saying you broke the law. However, the driving culture is that you are SUPPOSED to exceed the speed limit by 5-10 mph depending on the situation and if you stay within the speed limit, you are a nuisance on the road (and possibly dangerous). This is stupid. Why not raise the speed limit 5-10 mph and enforce it as a HARD LIMIT with everyone being expected to drive slightly slower? This grey area in the law makes it so that effectively everybody is guilty of breaking the law, and it is up to the discretion of the police officer whether or not they feel like ticketing someone. It doesn't really make sense.They didn't get it right - left lane is for PASSING.  Which means if you aren't actively passing someone you need to move over over.  Does not matter if you're 10 under or 30 over the speed limit.There is no fast lane.  There is the passing lane.  If you are doing 5 miles over the speed limit in the "fast lane" do you think that can keep you from a ticket?

"I was in the fast lane!"[deleted]so they're encouraging people to speed?  or do they expect everyone in the fast lane to drive exactly at the speed limit?Dennis Leary hates this law. 

He like to drive slow in the ultra fast lane. 

While people, behind him, are going insane. pfft... still does nothing about that time that a Nevada highway patrol officer gave me a ticket for 108 in a 70 zone.The problem isn't people going slower than the speed limit, it's people going exactly the speed limit, or 5 over, with the logic of "I'm not speeding so this is fine". If they want to fix this, the law should be that the left lane is for passing only.Really it should be a capital offense. If they enforce it, this shit needs to go nation wide. The next stop can be the Bay Area. Is there anyway you can upvote something a million times?I'm also tired of getting behind drivers doing 20 in a 35 on my lunch break which is only 30 minutes.CA needs to jump on that trainFucking finally!! Do this in all states. Also let us crush them with tanksBout god damn time[deleted]I'm seeing some posts on here that are making the cops out to be hardlined as if you're gonna get a ticket for doing +-1mph. It don't work that way.
The cops here are gonna give you leeway.
They aren't gonna pull you over for passing 5 over, if you fly by in the passing lane 20 over you gonna get nabbed. And they aren't gonna pull you over got going under do long as you don't hold up traffic (within reason.) look guys, I know cops aren't perfect. There are shit heads out there, but lets use common sense.Tennessee passed this last year. It isn't enforced.If this doesn't sum up why laws regarding driving speeds need a complete overhaul, I don't know what does. Virginia passed a bill like this, this year as well.  $250 or $300 ticket, and it's a primary offense, as in they can pull you over for it by itself.
But isn't it illegal to drive over the speed limit, even in the fast lane? In jersey the ‘fast lane’ is now only the passing lane. Dont get caught driving in it too long or some state trooper will pop out of nowhere and pull you over.  Almost guaranteed a ticket ITT: "PASSING LANE !!!1!1!1!!1!1!1!1!" 

It isn't in most states. It's about half of the states where it is.

Most simply have it as a fast lane or suggested for passing, with no laws saying you can't travel in the left lane.

 But this is one of those topics where the hive mind remains uneducated and circlejerks itself to death.

[Relevant article](https://www.jalopnik.com/5501615/left-lane-passing-laws-a-state-by-state-map/)This won't improve anything, other than giving them another revenue source.  It's just another ticket-able offense the highway patrol can use on people driving through the state.Wait, so if that law is in effect, and speeding laws are too, couldn't they just pull over anyone driving in the fast lane? Great, you just created the "cruise control at the speed limit in the left lane, lane"

So pretty much, this will change nothing about most freeway traffic in NevadaWait, isn't going above the speed limit illegal?This works in Georgia.  Except its not the speed limit. If a car is approaching at a faster rate of speed from behind you in the left lane, you merge right as soon as you can safely.  So even if I'm going 85, I gotta get over for the dude going 90. I've seen cops just hit their blues until someone is a lane or two over, then keep on keepin on.Good because those SOBs need to be hung from the tallest tree in the county.Cool.  It's now illegal to drive below the speed limit there.

It's also illegal to drive above the speed limit, anywhere.

So what speed is it legal to drive at in the leftmost lane?  Exactly the speed limit only?  By what measurement?  I recently compared my speedometer to my Garmin bike computer speed.  When my speedometer was indicating 83 mph, my Garmin indicated 77.  

It looks like it would be nearly impossible to drive in the leftmost lane fully in compliance with the law now.The totalitarian principle: Everything not forbidden is compulsory.So unless you are going exactly the speed limit you can get pulled over? speeding or going too slow? That's a nice excuse for cops to pull people over.Seems like it would make more sense to just say “left lane for passing only.” Driving exactly the speed limit in the left lane still slows down and pisses off a lot of people.check out r/bayarea and all the left lane drivers defending their shitty drivingIt's not the fucking fast lane.....

It's a passing lane.

The fact people keep calling it a slow lane means people should drive in it rather than use it to pass.Let's go CAThis is directly related to marijuana. I live in colorado and people doing 5 under the limit is a regular thing. My mom does this and I think she's trying to convince other drivers to slow down too...HEROES.I thought the fast lane was for overtaking. Your not supposed to be cruising in it in the first place. According to a study I read. Making faster moving cars pass on the right is more dangerous than speeding. All I know is someone is getting pulled over on the highway regardless of what they do.I feel like the majority of the problem is thinking of it as the "Fast Lane" and calling it as such.

If we all start referring to it as what it really is, the Passing Lane, maybe over time we wont need laws for things like this.Finally introducing some fucking road etiquette to America Good, they need that law here in the SF Bay.Every state needs to follow suit. 

Driving is a privilege, not a fucking right. People need to start behaving appropriately and have some respect on the road. Why can't the drivers in the USA be like EU?I wish we had a law like this in the Netherlands. You won't believe how many times it happens some asshat drives 100 kph in the left lane to pass a truck while the speed limit is 120 or 130 kph. Just last week there was a row of cars at least half a mile long behind an idiot who didn't feel like driving faster than 100 kph. If I had anything to say about they'd all lose their license.Now driving in the left lane is illegal. You can't go over the speed limit, nor under it.THIS IS THE BEST NEWS EVER!I find this hilarious that republicans would force bigger government Tennessee added this law last year. Nothing has changedIt appears that Nevada has an asshole problem.

"I drive really slow in the ultrafast lane
While people behind me are going insane
I'm an asshole
(He's an asshole, what an asshole)
I'm an asshole
(He's an asshole, such an asshole)"

That's on the booklet when you first get your license. 
They should do that in Florida. It's the passing lane.So you must not be below or over the speed limit in the fast lane or you'll get a ticket? Sounds like a money making scheme.they NEED this in Minnesota!Kind of defeats the purpose of a speed *limit*I believe it was once said by the late great Jeremy Clarkson that any one who drives slow in the fast lane is a pedophile. Due to the fact that the best place to hide is going slow in the fast lane bc no one is prosecuted for it.So it's illegal to drive below the speed limit and I assume it's still illegal to drive above the speed limit. That doesn't leave a lot of wiggle room. God fucking damnit just today I was going to work on a 2 lane highway and one semi on the right lane, ok good and then a fucking asshole on the left lane in front just coasting at the same speed of the truck....I HAD NOWHERE TO GO! fucking bitch. There is no fast lane...Yeah, a few states have this law. People still do it. Police don't enforce it. Actually, most states don't have any kind of "Passing lane" law (Only 7 have a keep right when not passing law). Here is a list of laws for lanes in each state.

http://www.mit.edu/%7Ejfc/right.html
There's no such thing as a "fast lane."

There's a "passing lane" though.Georgia has that and they don't do shit about it. Awesome!! Now someone other than me can tell my mom she's driving too damn slow. They have that Law here in Atlanta. But no one obeys traffic laws or the speed limit. If you are doing 80 mph you are going too slow.Americans, learn this simple rule and abolish such notion as a fast lane. At the very least do it in Europe where it is law. Makes things so much simpler and better.

"It is illegal to not drive in the right most lane unless you are passing someone. Speed and lanes are only correlating as a result of this. It is also illegal to pass someone on their right."


Seems like a perfect excuse for fucking people over through fines. I mean it is like 90% of their job to generate revenue from the working poor. Cool, I'll stay in the left lane doing the speed limit. Passing lane.....it's supposed to be for passing only.In australia you have to be within 20kmh of the speed limitWhy even have a speed “limit" if it is used as a minimum in situations like this. Name it something that makes more sense and only enforce citations on reckless driving, which may include going too far over a recommended speed. Can they do this in Atlanta? And to teach people how  to signal when switching lanes? And how to drive in  little bit of drizzle? And to actually do something about the amount of people who text and drive even though it's illegal? Lots of states already have laws like this (WA has keep right except to pass) but do not enforce. 

I've been pulled over multiple times in my MS3 by cops thinking I [didnt have a front plate](http://i.imgur.com/XPRejBn.jpg) but I have never ONCE seen them pull someone over camping in the left lane. 

In fact, [they had to make an announcement](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/washington-state-patrol-plans-crackdown-on-left-lane-camping/) that they were going to start citing people for this but only for a short window.So it's illegal to drive below the speed limit. It's illegal to drive above the speed limit. So you have to drive exactly the speed limit?Why is this turning into an actual law? You shouldn't be driving slow in the fast lane anyway in the first place. Whoever does that should get their license revoked. If you want to drive slow, you use the right lane.This is a silly law. No one in the fast lane drives below the speed limit. The issue is drivers who go slower than the traffic behind them, but are themselves either at the speed limit or faster.

Example: Most traffic is doing 80, but a driver is doing 70 in the fast lane causing a slow-down.

This is the main issue in traffic from my observations.They need an ad campaign with Hitler driving slow in the left lane so people will understand how bad it isGood. Slow drivers are much more dangerous than fast drivers. Nevada Passes Law Making It Illegal To Drive Slowly (below the speed limit) In The ~~Fast~~ **Passing** LaneAsians....read up on this law. IIRC, it's also illegal to drive over the speed limit in the fast lane (that's why it's called the speed *limit*): the only way you're allowed to pass someone is if they're going under the speed limit in the slow lane.

...So, NV just made it illegal to drive any speed other than the speed limit in the fast lane?They should make it illegal to stay in the left lane for more than 1 minute. That would be far more effective. Since moving to California from Florida, I've notice Californians love to just stay in the passing lane forever. They never get over no matter how many people are lining up to pass. Forcing drivers to pass from the right.This is one step closer to an American Autobahn... too bad most Americans will sue someone if they abuse the rules and screw something up because it *can't be their fault*The law is great in theory- but it's difficult to enforce and left lane cruisers will still sit in the left lane (within the law) despite the traffic flow being 75+ like it is in the DC metro area.It's called the passing lane. In the 90's, Car&Driver used to have as part of their car test, how easily the heater controls could be operated with bulky winter gloves on. (They're in MI.)  It was a rail against tiny buttons back then, but the idea still stands.The cancer is infecting Industrial machinery too. Its fucking awful.I don’t understand why a row of user configurable buttons aren’t a thing. Give drivers the flexibility of software-driven interfaces/UX with the safety and repeatability of physical switches. Drivers can customize to taste. 

Ford had to back pedal on the Mach-E and glued a knob to the touchscreen.I will not buy a car that requires you to use a touchscreen for things you might need to adjust while driving. This includes volume and HVAC. 

Most dangerous trend in the industry. Hey let's ban cell phones while driving but stick an even bigger more distracting touchscreen on the dash of every new vehicle.Related: in Germany, the use of touch screens during a drive has been ruled illegal.

The cause for this ruling was a guy in his Tesla model 3 crashing into a bunch of trees while operating the touch screen.

But here's the kicker: what the guy was *trying* to do was not to change the radio station or something trivial like that. He was trying to change the setting for the wind shield wipers, because it was raining! Tesla relegated the fucking wind shield wipers controls to the *touchscreen*

How absolutely retarded is that?![deleted]In the UK it's illegal to operate your mobile phone whilst driving yet you can poke endlessly at your touchscreen to find a radio station or set your climate to 20.65⁰. Makes sense /s. I'm loathe to go to a newer daily because of stupid design and shitty build quality.They won't stop. It s how they cut costsThis. And button/dial gearshifts too. Can’t stand those[removed]I couldn't agree more. It's much harder to operate a touch screen while driving. Most of the basic functions (sports mode, climate controls, heated seats, radio) should be in button form so you can easily access them on the move.

I think auto manufacturers know this, and in reality are switching to touch screens because they're cheaper. A digital interface, shared amongst manufacturers, is much cheaper to introduce and skin than an analogue interface requiring a unique design for each model, not to mention the cost of the metal buttons and dampening required to make a classy interior.Thats why I love the 21 Mazda3 interior controls. They did NOT install a touch screen they left it as just a screen/monitor. They kept it all analog and you control everything via buttons and twist knobs. Very intuitive controls right in front of the armrest.I'm old, I hate touch screens. They're so fucking annoying to use when you're moving. They're awesome if you aren't, but that's (hopefully) not a common occurrence while driving. The only thing that makes them tolerable on most new cars is the good steering wheel/voice controls. Touch screens in cars remind me of trying to type out a text message on your phone, and you keep hitting O and it keeps giving you a fucking I for no conceivable reason. It's just an extra layer of frustration that actual buttons eliminate since they don't move around on you or suffer from interface lag.They can pry the volume knob out of my cold dead hands!!!The screens on new Volvos use infrared sensors which allows them to work while using gloves.[deleted]I think trying to use a touchscreen while driving is the most ridiculous design.The Jetta had finally left her stranded for the last time. Although we had both worked hard to not only get out of debt but stay that way, I knew she was right when she said it was time to go to the dealership. We had to have a reliable car. 

Three weeks and several awkward, sometimes tense conversations later, I had taken the burden on myself to find a car that would fit her needs. As far as I could tell, it shouldn’t be too difficult. I had listened intently as she discussed with the handful of poor salesmen that were unfortunate enough to approach her on the lot, that all she needed was something that seated 15 people, got 60 mpg, had 1,000 HP, was easy to park, and could be had for around $10K. 


...yep. 

After a little coaxing (and secretly reading a book on FBI hostage negotiations) I was able to convince her a mid-size sedan would fit the bill. I found the most beautiful Cadillac ATS money could buy. ‘14, 40k miles, one owner, and $23k would take it home. I went alone to the dealer with my letter of finance from the credit union and drove it myself. It was awesome. 

The next day, with Pretty Wife in tow, we “happened” across the car lot where the ATS was and I asked “what about tha Caddie?”. She loved it. After a test drive, all kinds were made up and we pulled back I got the lot to start paperwork. She parked next to a Buick Regal. 

“Is that one for sale? Can we drive it?”

I started sweating. All this work behind the scenes I had done could be immediately unraveled if she was conflicted after another test drive. Yet, I relented and we took the Buick down the road also. She loved it more. I was perplexed. Same options, but with less miles and even less money. I asked her on the ride home why she chose it instead of the Cadillac.

“I like the buttons instead of the touch screens.”If it doesn’t have a volume knob I’m not buyingThing is, people LIKE the touch screens. They sell cars. Maybe not here and maybe not to everyone, but blame Tesla.Oof I still remember when Honda refreshed the 9th gen Accord and had touch controls instead of a volume knob. Even today the Touring V6 is a great car for what you're paying but man not having a volume knob hurts. At least they realized and fixed it for the 10th gen.Volvo's touch screen is at least usable with gloves.I got a 2015 Acura with touch screen controls. Hated it.  It is now on my next car purchase check out list.  Go through the onscreen controls thoroughly.  If you don't like it before you buy it - don't buy it.Thank you toyota, love them old school oversized plastic buttons and knobs.Preaching to the choir here. I got in the GTFour today in the pouring rain, punched a few buttons and adjusted a slider, and was demisting in two seconds.I like what Audi has done with new Q3 interior, imo perfect blend of physical buttons/knobs and 2 great screens. Plus, the main infotainment is integrated into the dashboard.

That being said, I think touch functions for AC are here to stay. But I don't like how  VW and Mercedes are lately making steering wheels with capacitive buttons , not that I ever used such steering wheels myself though.I know, right? Searching and looking for the correct touch to increase the Aircon? No problem. But don't you dare touch your phone while driving, it's dangerous!I got “upgraded” on a business trip a few years back and instead of my old reliable Nissan Altima, National gave me a Cadillac ATS.

First thing I noticed was how it felt like the designers had just then learned about haptic feedback.  Like everything had it.  

Change temperature? BUZZ
Recline the seat? BUZZ BUZZ
Volume up? BUZZ BUZZ BUZZ

So many buzzes!  That was when the interaction actually worked.  Since almost everything was a touchscreen or Taptic interface, I never knew if I was changing the station or getting the GPS to work.

It was awful.  It was the most distracting,  car driving experience ever.  I’m good with a touchscreen on my phone: on my car?  Give me a goddamn knob.I also hate digital gauges.They don’t care, whatever makes the most money is all they care aboutYa know, I don't think it's that bad. But the fact that every touchscreen in a car has the same response times and resolution as a 2007 smartphone are what kills it

Like seriously, it's ridiculous that in 2020 they're not all basically iPads in the car. Realistically, it costs the manufacturer like $50-$150 more and would drastically improve the experience.They need to ad tactile or audible feedback.

So you can tell when your finger is on a certain setting, it will either vibrate, or make a tone. Then you push harder to select.

That way they can keep the fancy touchscreens but then you can also tell what you are touching without looking.

It’s only a matter of time before they implement it.I don't even like automatic windows because of the winter.My grandad used to be a pilot in WW2, and when I was little he told us how his blind flight / night flight trainings went with every button and lever being recognizable by shape or texture. So one of his key criterias for picking his cars for the rest of his life was if it could be driven without looking at switches. 
I think he got a point, I'm already annoyed if I have to look for my defrost switch that hides in a row of other AC switches.
I don't get how touch controls can be approved in cars when you're not allowed to touch your smartphone.With a federal mandate to have backup cameras, you already have a screen there so might as well make it touch control. Less electronics and wiring running to each button/switch and you can market it better. 

I prefer buttons/dials. Especially a temp dial that I can just spin to red to make it hot. None of this, 'hmmm do I want to set the climate control to 74 or 78 today??'Yes! I hate them. Had two loan cars earlier this year, VW Polo and Golf and both had touch screens, not hard to suss out where stuff was, but anything besides a race track quality surface and I was constantly pushing the wrong buttons.We are past the sweet spot in cars. That perfect mix of useful technology with practical driving needs.

Cars are now overweight complicated iPads with four wheels.

My want list for vehicles Is entirely from the used market.Plenty of new cars have the right balance.  My 2020 ford has buttons/knobs for all the right things.This is a huge safety issue. You cannot do anything without looking at the screen. I cannot believe this has been so widely adopted. My old Toyota Camry had three simple knobs to control the heating/ac which were simple to use without taking your eyes off the road. I will take that anytime.Thank you. I don't want, I \*need\* to be able to adjust things on the dash without looking away from the road. I can control dials and buttons by feel, can't do that with a screen.**Nothing** in a car that the driver can be expected to adjust while driving should be on a touch screen, it's a shitty and dangerous solution to a problem that didn't exist before said screens.
With a know or a button you can easily control everything through sheer muscle memory and you get physical feedback that tells you if your action has been successful.

With a screen you have to look down to see what you're doing because there is no feedback on whether you're pushing the correct button or not. In Sweden it has become illegal to use your phone while driving but for some reason giant fucking screens that function the exact same are a-ok to put into the car itself?Buy a volvo, gloves work with the touch screen. It's two buttons to adjust the climate features. It works very well once you get use to it.Some automakers are going back buttons and dials for certain interaction, which is good news. For complicated stuff like navigation or drive settings should stay in the touch display for simplicity, although how intuitive the design of the touchscreen is also a big problem still.Ugh, yes, this. I might be able to excuse it on cheap cars, thanks to the potential for cutting costs, but on a luxury vehicle? Compared to the cheap stuff, you should be looking to make the controls feel *better*-- through the use of premium switch mechanisms with better tactile feedback, better materials, more satisfying (if also more expensive) button form factors-- not worse.Didn't the civic remove the volume button for one year lmaoIts cheaper to make a screen then proper set of mechanical switches. But its awfully dangerous. You have to look away from road to change anything, going trough countless sub menus..Along with this, I also find that touch screens are more dangerous than dials because you have to take your eyes off the road to control itThis is the world people wan. More technology, regardless of how useless it is. They want things like touchscreens because it makes them feel rich and important and classy and that they're keeping up with the Jones's, not because they're actually better than physical buttons and knobs. For fucks sake there are screens on good damn refrigerators now. They don't need to be there, they serve little purpose, but people will pay more for it because it makes them look high class when people walk in their kitchen and see a fridge with a screen on it.

People are afraid of living in an analog world for some reason, and it's just sad.Amen, I feel the same.  Climate control and radio controls need to be dials and buttons.  The Tesla screen controls the windshield wiper speed lol.  That’s a hard pass for me.Analog is satisfying, controllable, and just. makes. sense.I want my big back up camera screen... but NO touch screen. No tactile feedback from a touch screen so I have to physically look. Makes bad driving.We need some federal regulation around this. 

Cell phone laws are everywhere, and rightfully so, but it's fine legally to be rooting around in a worse interface on your dash to change the volume. 

We need to specify physical buttons for a number of common in-car functions. Whatever the research says is the top 4-8 things. Mandate physical buttons just like they mandate the red color in tail lights. 

Next Secretary of Transportation is Pete Buttigieg. Let's write him.[deleted]It's also 100x as expensive to repair/replace if something stops workingHonda went to all touch screens in 16 and they are already Reversing adding some buttons backGod yes. Here's one - I have an extremely long driveway. So I turn my car on, start backing up - but then I realize I want to adjust the radio. Nope. The entire user interface is gone since the backup camera is on and the touchscreen is displaying the camera view. I have to stop the car, put it in park, wait for the UI to update, tap the touchscreen to adjust the radio, put the car back in R, and start backing up again.How can touchscreen controls be safe to operate when a cellphone is unsafe and they are in essence the same thing? We should ban touchscreens in cars because they are unsafe.RADIO AND CLIMATE CONTROLS SHOULD NOT BE ON THE SAME SCREENLess buttons, more?All I can imagine is when these cars get a little older you'll have to scrap a perfect running car because the screen took a shit and you can't defrost your windows or turn down the radioThis is one of the reasons I loved my honda fit so much, the climate controls were just, how fast, how hot, where. And all analog, and then in the 2020 they added a volume knob back to the radio. I bought a civic si cause I wanted to trade up to something quicker and a bit sharper to drive and although a couple climate functions are touch there's a huge physical override button to get to them and the main stuff like heat and speed is analog. UX design > flashy uiI just love finger banging tactile flippy switches. Click oooooooh, clack aaaaaaaah, click oooooooh. Don't get me started on indexed knobs.Stop filling out surveys saying the Tesla interior looks the most modern.Mazda has entered the chat. They refuse to make their screens touch screen and instead rely on buttons and dials. I like this method since after a while using you memorize where everything is and do not need to take your eyes of the road.I miss the good old days when I could control temperature and fan speed directly. Now I have to guess what number will make the computer blow cold air.Buy Mazda. No touch screens.AmenI agree. It's also much more dangerous as you HAVE to look at the screen to operate it, whereas a button you can just feel while keeping your eyes on the road.I believe Mazda came out recently to say they are returning to using physical buttons in their vehicles. I hope other manufacturers follow their lead.

I think Tesla has a lot to answer for for this bollocks, they were the first (that I can think of) that replaced virtually all buttons with a big fuck-off iPad and now that is seen as 'modern' other manufacturers are copying their lead, which is unfortunate.I’ll never have a new car, but, having to try to use that screen junk while I’m a passenger in someone else’s is hard enough. You have to LOOK at it - so if you’re the driver - that’s not good! You can use knobs and buttons without taking your eyes off the road.True. And I do not like knobs for a shift lever either. Give me buttons (like the old Plymouths or Edsels) or a lever on the dash board. Yes, buttons are more expensive to produce and install but come on now.I agree. It’s especially annoying with slow, unresponsive touch screensThe new Subaru Outbacks have a ridiculous touch screen with all this shit built into it. I hate when I get 70+ customers trading in their 2012 Outback and want a new Outback, it's a fucking space shuttle for them. It's almost to the point where people over a certain age, I try to skip the Outback entirely and go for a Forester because there's still analog controls.

At least half of the older folks (again, like 70+) I get that come in for an Outback, leave in a Forester after driving an Outback. Shit is too complicated. People don't want to open a touchscreen menu to change the climate control from Feet to Face and Feet.Looking at you [Kia Sorento 2021](https://blogmedia.dealerfire.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/361/2020/09/2021-Kia-Sorento-infotainment-1_o.jpg)Future is now, old manAnalog > digital in 99% of circumstances and no one change my mind.I think it’s so that they have more control over servicing/repairs. Something that cannot be fixed at home or by your local workshop so must be repaired by the dealership. I read a lot of farmers are buying 30/40 year old tractors. Purely because when something breaks they can repair it themselves and not need a rep to come out, plug a laptop in to diagnose the issue then have to be repaired by then....,Okay but just don't buy those cars eitherI’m soooo against no keyhole except for the driver’s door! It irks me so much when my fob’s battery dies and I want to open my trunk and I have to unlock the driver’s door with a key to press the button to unlock the car to open the trunk!!! Keyholes, people!!! A door, a keyhole.You know why you never have to look down at your TV remote? Like that. Cars need to make controls familiar like that.Is there a Cars Circle Jerk sub this can be posted too?No thanks, I’ll take a screen that does multiple things than 100 buttons that do 1 thing.The other annoying thing about screens is that it's less convenient than buttons, because you have to switch to the "right" screen to get stuff done. I was used to adjusting the climate control by feel so I don't have to look away from the road; can't do that with the interface in some of the newer cars.Big reason I bought the LX trim for my Accord. Not enough difference in features except for a touch screen radio. I don’t like touch screen radios, they are glitchy and a pain in the dick when you are driving.I HATE KEY FOBSWhy don’t you just buy a car that doesn’t have this?Buy older carsNoBring back cd players.This is why I dread having to buy a modern car. I don’t want anything newer than 2015, and each year that gets further away...I bought a brand new car 2 years ago. Touch sensitive heating controls on a Honda i was looking at was a big portion of the reason why i didn't buy it and i told the salesman that. It's bloody dangerous and outright unintuitive.
Drivers need buttons and switches so they can feel them and not take their eyes off the road.I truly hate the direction modern car design has gone. So many newer cars feel like they are designed to include as many distractions from the road as possible. And, in my opinion, to be as infuriating to control as possible. 

I should under absolutely no circumstances have to do more than glance down at the HVAC controls to do anything I need to do while driving down the road. Everything should be doable by feel. Basic media controls, too, should not require the driver to take their eyes off the road for more than a few moments. I understand that some modern media functions may be impossible to do then, like XM Radio station choice, but changing volume, changing from radio to CD to aux-in, changing radio station/band or CD track should always have a physical button that can be operated with no or very little visual attention.

I also hate power windows and automatic transmissions with a passion and think new cars are a terrible financial decision, so I'm clearly not the target market.Car Automaker: *No*Car reviewers live in Florida or Arizona.    What gloves?

Why don’t you just buy cars without a touch screen.   Plenty of those aroundToday I watched a humanoid robot do a fucking perfect backflip and now this. I think this is officially the future. 620-mile range is crazy. If that's the future for electric vehicles, I'm down. How the fuck can it do 250?How the hell did we go from the current Tesla to this 630 mile range supercar... I just want a Honda Accord type car with this kind of range. What the hell kind of tire are they going to run to handle that kind of launch? Probably fair to assume it's AWD as well?1.9 seconds? Holy fuck....Millionaires are gonna be wrapping these things around trees like crazylol, it's so fast it'll be straight up illegal to dragrace anywhere with real rules. Those are parachute and full rollcage required numbers jesus tap dancing christ

[deleted]I'm still confused as to how it pulls off a 1.9s 0.60 on DOT tires. Anyone chime in? haha  
edit: not being negative, I want one. Let's see how it does on the track, or lap-after-lap. The Model S has good peak performance, but the battery overheats relatively soon.anyone attempting to exceed 250 mph should expect minutes of treadTesla blowing right past Ludacris send going straight to plaid with this thing. Mel Brooks would be proud.[deleted]It's the 620 mile range that entices me more than the speed.
Speed is sort of a party trick with an electric motor, but making batteries both light weight and hyper efficient is a engineering feat.  If we maintain this curve, we'll see 1000-mile ranges at reasonable prices by 2025.I don't even care about the numbers, that car is *beautiful*. 

I fucking love it. Those performance figures are so ridiculous. I love it.If there's one thing /r/cars must not hate about Tesla it has to be this.

https://www.tesla.com/roadster/?redirect=noAnyone know if the performance figures have been tested or if they're just targets at this point?I have a new dream now. If this thing is even remotely what Elon says it is...

I need to get rich quick.This sounds amazing but I’m still worried about weight.. a 200kwh battery pack will weigh a shit ton. 85kwh pack in the model s is 1200 pounds, so we are talking 2500 pounds just for the battery. Unless there is a major breakthrough is battery tech that drops he weight way down we are looking at a 4500 pound car which is too heavy for track duty :( [Tesla Roadster Page](https://www.tesla.com/roadster/) - Now Live

A lot of confused boners in this sub rnHoly fucking Shit!!!I am skeptical but on paper it’s ridiculous. Please let this happen. 

I’m not sure how I feel about sharing the road with it though. It's official,  tesla and dodge are in a pissing match.That is neck-breakingly fast. Honestly. How do you even drive like that? How do you not get extreme tunnel vision or rollercoaster drop sensations x5 in this?Hmm 250+ mph top speed... It's undeniable they have the power/tq necessary for it, but do they have the handling/chassis/suspension tech to rival that of other 250+ mph production cars like the Koenigsegg?  Meaning can it do 250mph+ "safely"?What is super fast but never arrives?So to reserve one they want $5k deposit (which is fine) but then within 10 days they want another $45k to $245k depending on which car you want.... How high are they? They want me to basically given them an interest free loan for 2-3 years IF they can deliver the car in that time frame. Frankly, that's a load of shit.When I look back at the beginning of my wealth, I'll have this cars incentive to thank. This is unreal, I need one. Obviously given them having problems with getting things to scale, this won't be actually out in awhile.

That being said I'm fine with a prototype to look at even if it's not out for 3-4 years. Could I drag race this thing in fully autonomous mode? That'd be awesome if you could just have the car race for you. It'd probably be horrifying, but cool. >starting at $200,000, with the first 1,000 sold being Founder’s Series models that will retail for $250,000 apiece

r/Nvidia is leaking.[deleted]Holy shit. I feel ancient now for owning a 2017 STIIf it seats 4 it's not a roadster.those are amazing numbers if he can actually deliver what he is promising. well see how it is when it comes out in 2023It'll give the smackdown on ICE cars in the 0 - 60 I'll give it that much, but when it beats out the Veyron SS or the Agera RS then I'll believe him. 

If he put half as much effort into building a track car as he did trying to humiliate ICE's in a straight line, then he'd probably have the Nurburgring lap record right now.And it's a good looking car too. Why does seem Tesla is the only one who knows what's attractive. Meanwhile Audi has infotainment screens with such bad resolution and quality it looks like it was from 10 years ago. And that's a 1500$ package. Like fuck.ill just mount a damn iPad to the dash. Motortrend's annual drag race is about to get crazyCan't wait to see u/doug_demuro test this car out. Electric motors and their godddamn no transmissions and absurd acceleration... it's like the future has been hidden from us all along 

Edit: oil companies ha Great, now can it run around a track for a 30 min. session without going into limp mode? Last time I checked no Tesla could manage more than a few min of being driven hard before it overheated; So I really hope they fixed this one so that it at least has sufficient cooling. 

Oh, so Tesla CAN make a car that doen't look like its mouth has been sewn shut like Deadpool in X-Men Origins: Wolverine.Musk, Musk, hear me out. How's about you release one product successfully before revealing new products to distract investors from the fact that you're in "production hell" and can't find a way out.   

Also, I hope they have figured out how to cool these EVs when they're being put to use for HPDE. Otherwise, it'll be entirely useless to have a roadster with that kind of performance that enters limp mode after half a lap.10,000Nm of Torque? I don't believe in physics anymore 

I want blue flame coming out of the exhaust, a tremendous noise and little kids in my neighbourhood to be running to their mothers in fear when they see a car.  Electric cars don't do any of that...Key quote from source article: "Nissan now has one of the oldest product portfolios in the industry"

in every headlines these days?Nissan isn’t like how they use to be, they’ve lost hella brand recognition and those CVT transmissions are complete shit, they lost me years agoI worked at a Nissan dealership for 2 days, was told I'd be getting a 90 day training program, it was a day and half of the sales manager bragging about how the married life is stupid and how he makes so much money. After that I was told to stand outside in the rain and hope for so,some to come in. After an hour he reprimanded man for standing outside like "a fucking nobody". He then sits me at a cubicle with all the other dealers and a list of phone numbers of anybody that has ever had any interaction with Nissan. You bought a lightbulb for your Toyota Camry 6 years ago in an emergency, well now I'm calling at 6:00 PM trting to get you to buy a Nissan.  I would have to call and try and get a appointment out of you and I had a quota of 1 appointment a day and 2 on the weekends from the phones alone. Throughout the day the General Manager walked back and forth on a catwalk overlooking all the sales floor and if you weren't on the phone for longer than a minute you were being disciplined. After about 50 calls I got up to go the bathroom and instead I headed out the side door and never talked to them again.It’s nice that this new CEO seems to care about making the brand better but he’s got a lot of work to do. What’s the point of buying a Nissan? I can’t think of anything that any of their models do better than their competitors. Give us a new Z and a new GTR. Make the Titan worth considering when up against the Tundra. Make a 4Runner competitor that doesn’t make milkshakes in its transmission. Get rid of those headlights that seek to increase eye doctor visits. Do *anything*. 

More than any other brand, Nissan has let their cars stagnate. It’s hard to believe that they’re still selling 2020 GTR Nismo’s for over $200,000 when it’s the same design that it was over a decade ago. Same with the 370. And they can’t compete with anyone. Try harder Nissan!Nissan has literally skipped a generation of innovation in order to peddle out an unchanged product across multiple lines to maximize profits on outdated platforms.

Car reviewers as well as the public has been quite outspoken over this for years, this isn't a fucking surprise.

Nissan's product line is archaic, losing Carlos may be the best thing to happen to Nissan in the past 10 years.

In other news, Nissan stock is at an all time low, probably not a bad time to buy.I really, really dig the Maxima platinums and everything they have.  I just can't ignore all of the consumer reports about the CVTs though.  It's a shame.Nissan is in rapid danger of becoming the next MitsubishiI love old Nissan but when I get rid of my '03 Maxima, I definitely will not buy a new Nissan Maxima solely due to the fact they have CVTs. Why does a 300hp V6 need to be paired with a shitty CVT? Give me a 6 speed manual or even an 8 speed auto with AWD and you truly have a "4DSC"

Also their whole lineup excluding the newly revised Altima and Maxima is terribly outdated. They need to update their cars more frequently.They’ve been struggling for twenty years.

Making low quality, unreliable models and selling re-branded Renault’s doesn’t help at all. Also, having a “flagship” car like the (R35) GT-R that has been almost the same for 20 years (the original prototypes from the current car are from 2001...) doesn’t help.

Hey, what about caring about doing quality and reliable cars like KIA and Hyundai have been doing.enthusiests wanted the 510 concept to be real... nissan didnt finish the project...toyota86 and the brz came out (what woulda been competition) and are killin it! SMH

&#x200B;

edit: yall comparing it to other cars that are mostly FWD... the 510 Would have sold imo being they were going to market it to enthusiest.. yes that probably would have changed but OG they said you could have bought one for cheap cheap, with no heat/ac no radio, no creature comforts... for folks who wanted to race it or get a bare bones one to mod. WOOD have been sweet. but i digress....   
i did notice it's still on nissans website as a future concept car but looks like an E-car now, shame[deleted]r/cars any time Nissan struggling comes up:

"They need a new Z!"

"They need a new GTR!!1"

"Why would anyone buy a Nissan at all when the Z and GTR are so old and out of date now???"

*Meanwhile in reality the 370z has sold only a total of 71,709 in the last ten years versus the Altima's ‭2,975,219‬*.

Ya'll really need to take care of this lust you have for the Z cars and the GTR because with the current state of things it's not going to happen. The GTR is a halo car and the Z cars are "we have money to waste on R&D for funsies" cars; both of which they'd be real stupid to put money towards when the rest of their lineup needs work.I really wanted a Q60. Those things are fucking beautiful. And the VR30.. Wonderful engine. But then you get inside it. They just now figured out AA/Carplay. For a 50k+ sticker car. 400 HP, rwd, no limited slip. Old ass shitty 7-speed. Infotainment from 2010.

Kinda the same with the Z. New, they're stupid.The best thing about Nissan engines is that Nissan has yet to build a transmission that can outlast one.When I see someone in a new Nissan, I just assume it's because they have poor credit and no one else will finance them. Same for Chrysler products. They're the Official Subprime Car ™As a non-car person, Jesus. I bought a Nissan truck in 2017 and had no idea this was going down. 

Have to say I’m happy with the truck and the dealership service has been top-notch.  No recalls, unlike my wife’s Passat, which seems to get a recall every year.Nissan is not a leader in any segment if im not mistaken. Even their trusty Rogue has lost its top status to the Rav4I'm a service writer and the amount of 2013-2018 Nissans with defective transmissions after 65k miles is insanely high. Just out of power train warranty too. Customers forking out 4-5k for a shitty car they're still making payments on.I guarantee not 1 word was uttered about the GT-R/Z. Dealers know what customers actually care about, and given the sales figures and trajectory of the market it's not those cars.

Thankfully the fixes Nissan needs are relatively skin deep. They can keep the existing platforms & engines. They just need refreshed interiors/exteriors, in the way that Toyota did with the '07-'17 Camry- it was the same car underneath the whole time. Update the infotainment as well (the Maxima's is really good) and get JATCO to ditch the CVTs for regular planetary autos. As a bonus, get onboard the realistic electrification train (aka hybrids). This won't set the world on fire but it will stop the bleeding and address the real needs of paying customers, which is ultimately all that matters for Nissan's survival.Nissan's got plenty of work to do to gain trust and reputation back. My dad's 01 Sentra hit 200k easily before the undercarriage rotted out. That thing prolly coulda lasted another 50k easy otherwise. 

But the past generation of their cars and SUVs were average to mediocre when they came out and sorely outdated by the time the new gens came out this past year. Their lineup is being updated finally and they have the looks but let's hope the reliability on the new models are much better than they've been previously.Nissan is the new Pontiac.

They have a pedigree, but have seemed increasingly lost and stagnant. It won’t be long before the brand is dead with the average car buyer- even if they turn around with good product.When the CVT went out at 68,000 miles on my ‘07 Altima, please don’t question too hard why I didn’t bother replacing it with another Nissan product.Easy fixes here, get rid of the CVT.  Traditional automatics are way better.  The CVT system is way too dimwitted to figure out where to shift to put the power to the wheels.

Next is to not make cars just for fleet sales.  I work at alamo national, and the number of Maxima, Altima, Sentra, Versa, Kicks, Rogues, Sports, Frontiers, Pathfinders, and Armadas is astounding.  And many of them come back with sensor blocking issues, and fishtailing complaints, especially in the ones that are exclusively FWD.  Distribute weight more evenly or give more of your cars intelligent AWD.Kudos for a CEO asking for frank responses, but Nissan really needs a through overhaul. Uh-huh products don't really do it anymore, and companies which used to do so (e.g. Toyota) has gotten the message.We had a Nissan Micra in Canada as a company car. Thankfully it was on lease because within less than 2 years it was rusting everywhere. It didn't look to me like the sheet metal is galvanized, or if it was it was a  supremely thin coat.

Every Nissan I've seen in the last 5 or so years has been complete garbage which is unfortunate because they used to make some really great cars.Imagine a Nissan GT-R with a CVT.

Lmao.Bought my first 2013 Nissan Altima.
Nothing but fucking problems.   Paper thin windshield, the fucking rust everywhere, my wheel breaking off 90 km/h.  All bearings replaced (yeah... all highway driven too).  Car has just over 120k.   My 2008 Honda Accord has 1/2 the rust and 10% of Nissan’s problems at 360k kmI used to like Nissan despite their propensity for eating motor mounts. The last Maxima I bought was pure crap. Never again. They are the worst Japanese brand.Their CVTs will be their demise. They deserve to go broke since they sold to Renault.Their product has gone to shit. From the transmissions to the lack of warranty support. Imagine your CVT transmission craps out on your 3 year old car and they tell you "here's 5k to put toward your repair" instead of just replacing the transmission. They are a fucking joke.My tranny went out on our nissan quest, they want $5,600 to replace it. While in the shop, guy next to me stated he had the same problem. Did a little research and man.... Those CVT tranmissions suck. Never buying a Nissan againThe worst experience I ever had was at a Nissan dealership in SoCal. Right off the Cahuenga pass near Universal. I think it might have even been Universal Nissan ... with the like 3 story building that has cars on the roof.

What a total cluster fuck. I think it was 7pm, weeknight. I wanted to test drive a 370z (this was maybe 10 years ago). There were like 8 sales people buzzing around the place at that hour. It was a picturesque boiler room kind of night. Most or all of them were foreigners, yelling at each other in their native languages, sweat stains on their brightly colored Express shirts. The sales guy who came rushing over to me was clearly a newbie and his english was so incredibly poor that he might have truly only been living in the US for a few weeks or months.

Imagine the most anxiety ridden, overworked and pressured sales person ever trying to convince you to buy a 370z during a Wednesday evening *without being able to speak english*.

I couldn't fucking wait to get out of there.Man, these Nissan threads always devolve into the same "Nissan sucks" circle jerk.  Even if it's true, hasn't the horse been dead for a while now?  Do we need to keep beating it?  The comments are almost the same every timeYeah, but, zero gravity seats!The switch to CVTs were a mistake and ruined the company's imageShocking how even the dealers are raging that Nissans are fucking garbage, and people buy them every day.Almost anything Nissan has put out for the past 20 years, with the exception of the GTR, just feels mediocre.Seeing a lot of comments about Nissan on here, but haven't seen any mention of how they let Infiniti fall from grace. Their lineup in the mid-2000's era was great IMO, and they let their momentum die. Infiniti struck gold with the 4th gen G series. The M35/x was a great mid-sized sedan, and offered many features at a great price point. They had adaptive cruise & headlights, lane departure warnings, good power, solid looks, reliability, and a pretty good ride. The M45 had all of that and a V8 to boot. Add those to the variety of SUV's on tap, and Infiniti had a pretty great lineup across the board. But they let things fall out of shape, and I can't really see why someone would go with a new Infiniti over other options. Really a bummer for how good they used to be.It really seems like traditional car companies can't see beyond the next quarter earnings call which results in a lot of horrendous decisions being made.I like the way the recently refreshed sedans look both inside and out. I can’t speak to their quality on the interior though since I’ve not sat in anything aside from an Uber Sentra a year ago. 

I’d consider test driving an Altima if they put an 8 or 10 speed into it.Nissan fell fast when they partnered with RenaultYup. Nissan are absolutely turd in the UK. Once one of the reliable Japanese brands are trash.

Friends Qasqai has had problems with the gear box and electrics and it's only 2 years old.

Father's friend bought his wife a Pulsar and has regretted it.

Cutting costs and joining with the French did the no favours but then Renault and Citroën have pretty decent products compared to Nissan now...When someone tells you they bought a new Nissan the first response should be:

On purpose?Stop using those horrible CVT engines. Remodel all your cars. Get a new badge. Nissan is lazy compared to its competition. Honda, Toyota, Mazda, Hyuundai and Kia designed their cars from the ground up when they introduced their next generation models.

Nissan? Keeps using those bullshit CVTs and keeps reusing the same underpinnings on their cars since the early 2000s.I’m a Nissan Fan boy and I’ll say this 

If I was buying a half ton truck today I’d buy a tundra.

If I wanted a truck SUV chassis 4X4 I’d have to choice but to buy a 4 Runner.

If I wanted any car or small SUV not a base model with anything but a CVT I’d buy a Honda or Mazda..

Nissan needs to offer options in their drivetrains not everyone wants an uninspiring CVT.

The one thing that Nissan does to good is offer upper luxury in lots of options, I can’t even get a TRD Tundra at 55k+ with factory leather and Nissan has that optionSpeaking from firsthand experience, the Japanese business culture is obsolete in the context of western markets.  Toyota was resting on their laurels until the son of the founder, a car enthusiast with actual vision, took control and transformed their products a few years ago. 

The rest of them have been stagnant for about 10years, and while Honda, Mazda, and Subaru all make generally decent cars, and even some really good cars, there’s really nothing innovative coming out of any of them and with few exceptions their cars don’t inspire passion in most people. 

Japanese management in general is S L O W, not very creative, and afraid to take risks.  It starts with their cultural fear of bringing shame to themselves, and inability to question people with seniority, and it ends with a compensation structure that rewards maintaining the status quo and being extremely conservative. 

Look at the fields where Japan was once dominant, such as cars and consumer electronics, and you’ll see fields where the Korean’s have taken over and the rest of the world has caught up. 

One of the few counter examples I can think of is high end imaging (E.g. photography:  Canon, Nikon, Sony, Fuji still dominate that space) but in that space, the lack of innovation and external competition is leading to the death of the entire segment.  Even the latest high-end camera user interfaces and connectivity are horrendously behind every other area of the tech world.

With Nissan in particular, having to report to a non-Japanese (Ghosn) was shameful, so it wouldn’t surprise me to learn that there was significant infighting over the past 10 years that lead to Nissan’s current state.Had a 2015 Altima.  What an absolute pile of garbage.Every concurrent brand is going forward, especially Honda, Toyota and Hyundai. Meanwhile Nissan seems to be comfortably floating at where they are, not seeming to do anything.It's a real shame that all the cars in their current product range (with the notable exception of the GT-R) feel cheap, outdated and generally depressing in comparison to their direct competitors.

With Nissan's history of making some great cars, you'd expect more.  I hope they get their act together and catch up with the times.My favourite products from Nissan were the Infiniti EX and FX models, don’t care to find out what their current names are. Both models were very unique, in that they had longitudinally mounted engines while being small crossovers on sports car platforms. 

There is nothing that competed with the FX, except maybe the Macan. The EX had good proportions for a small crossover, more of a “lifted wagon” look. They went and ruined the EX, the replacement has a transverse inline 4 with a cvt and an overly complicated variable compression engine, all for a 2 MPG improvement from 20 to 22 combined; the EX had the venerable Nissan V6. Going from a V6 to an I4 with CVT, with the complicated inner workings, gave them a 2 mpg improvement! The FX is long gone with no replacement in sight. With how popular crossovers are, how come they haven’t put genuine thought into these products? It’s like they have given up.Ghosn cut corners and cheapened the brand, now unless they bring in some serious updates nothing is going to change and they will sadly go the way of SaabHad a two year old 45k Nissan frontier fail inspection for broken leaf springs not too long ago. That's pretty embarrassing,  forget about the trans coolers rupturing inside the radiators and causing complete transmission failure by 80k in the SUVs. Terrible cars.I own a Nissan Altima 2020 and for the most part, I really like the car but the CVT is pretty bad and some parts feel really cheap (plastic front passenger adjustment)Good! Nissan doesn’t offer loaner vehicles when your car is in getting serviced. The dealership my wife goes to gets a ton of flack for it and they hate that Nissan doesn’t have a program for it. The Chevy dealership across the street (under the same dealership conglomerate) does. I’ve received loaners from VW, Audi, GMC and Chevy. Way behind the times in customer service.Funnily enough, Ghosn was Nissan's savior back when the Altima 2002 got released. 
Amazing design by then standards, handled well, aluminum subframe and the engines were one notch above the competition. 
Like you could get a 240 hp midsize sedan when the rest at best were at 200.Nissans have been some of the worst cars I have ever driven, unfortunately. Jatco CVTs are absolute rubbish.Others have said it here, but it's obvious to anyone shopping for cars.

2020 prices, vehicle designs that haven't change since like 2003-2005, and crappy jatco/CVT transmissions... forget about it.

Back in the late 90's and early 2000's the VQ engine was an absolute beast and paired well with the maxima, altima, their trucks, and g35.  Now?  Uhhh... ya.

My next vehicle will be honda/acura or toyota/lexus.  Maaaaaybe Mazda.Nissan, I'll solve all your problems with 2 words: Electric IDx.This is sad. Nissan has made some great sports cars in the past and the GTR R35 was a show stopper when it debuted. I saw Titans and Xterras all over the place. Now I hardly see either. The CVT debacle unfolded and it all sank.[deleted]Yeah I’m going to need to see those empty numbers.Does that include the driver in the figure?

Still, a 400-mile range vehicle for 32k (post current incentive)?  Ford has knocked it out of the park.Perfect because most people I know drive trucks like an suv. Don’t see them use near max payload very often.They’re going to sell a shit load of these. I would wager that the average f-150 consumer customer is a homeowner (as opposed to a small car/crossover ev customer who may live in an apartment or condo) and therefore can install the charger. The business customers for who this truck makes sense (local delivery, light construction, trades) probably already have electric service that makes it easy to add the chargers and from a financial standpoint, can view the charging infrastructure as one time capex versus the ongoing opex of fueling traditional trucks. If the dollars make sense, any well run business will be switching to these if the use case warrants it.What kind of drive cycle for this range estimate? 1000 lbs will make a big difference in stop and go, but very little difference in cruising down the highway. There aero is a much larger factor.Goddamn does this, along with inflated the used Toyota truck resale prices right now, make me want to sell my 4Runner to get one of these…“Under promise over deliver.” Great move by Ford.Honestly, now I'm sold. If that turns out to be true, they will be converting a GM guy to a Ford guy. Well done!Bruh, my 2003 F-150 (V8; 5.4L) only has like a 250-mile range.

If I don't use 4WD.

If the weather is warm.

If I have no cargo whatsoever.

If the oil, spark plugs, and all filters are brand new.

If I have some highway mileage mixed in there.

Etc.

If this is true and its power/capabilities are at all comparable....man, they've knocked it out of the park.What about towing a 3k-4k boat, or a camper?I don't get it.  What's the point of a standardized test like the EPA rating if you are going to introduce extra variables?  Ratings like this are supposed to help the consumer compare different models, apples-to-apples.  

I´d very much like to see expanded EPA ratings for trucks, ranging from completely unencumbered to X amount of pounds on the bed, and then also towing some standard(in terms of weight and aerodynamic shape) trailer.  People need this info.I am just gonna leave my [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/nmoerr/mkbhdford_f150_lightning_impressions_better_than/gzrq5c6/) from the other thread here.Unless you're hauling 100 sand bags I dont think it will be more than a 30 mile increaseI wonder how big of a battery Is reqd for a Ford F-350 dually evFord has taken a page from Porsche’s playbook. Good for them.Well the typical American male in his 40s Accounts for 30% of that thousand pounds.My hybrid gets 30 miles max on electric.  When pure electric cars achieve ranges of 400-500 miles, it will be a game changer.[deleted]The Ford Lightning Raptor is going to be sick!Can't wait for my preordered Cybertruck!This is all just speculation.

Stop saying that Ford “under-promised and over-delivered”, they haven’t delivered anything yet.1000 pounds is basically 5 construction workers.So are the first buyers of these things going to pay MSRP for them?  I hate fucking dealers.  I wish Ford would change it up and sell these things at fixed prices.Good guy Ford, providing real-life, usable data. 

Propsyeah maybe if you put it in cruise control at 50Cool now make a Ranger EVThe real question is, what's the mpg if you exclusively charge your batteries with the optional built in generator?imagine how far it can go with nobody in itMaybe they didn’t realize that many of their trucks are never used to transport much more than a couple bags of groceries.Pressing x for doubt on this onePeople are cargo, we all understand that correctly? The cargo limit included is 1000 lbs, or roughly 2 and a half americans.I thought they might do something like this. Make an average and decent claim during the reveal and then say, "just kidding, those are the figures while loaded." Like telling everyone you're okay at chess and later revealing that you're a Master.Okay, EPA rating was done with 1000 pounds payload . Marques Brownlee has a video on the truck and someone at ford explained to him about the epa rating. He also shows the truck he drove has 360 miles on 80% battery. Which he used to calculate a range above 400 miles at 100%. Yes Ford did knock everyone out of the park. I’ll find the link to the video

Edit: [video](https://youtu.be/J2npVg9ONFo) time stamp 8:20A truck bed offers the ability for a second battery or even a generator to be placed for added range temporarily..It could be on jacks like a truck bed camper and be a rental like a U-haul.Neat. Wonder if it’ll pull a fifth wheel.I've never wanted a truck until I read about the electric version on the f150. I hope I don't fall in love with the country music and guns, when I buy one. Although, do those side effects come with an electric truck? I hope they don't, cause I fucking hate country music and guns.I call BS.Sounds like a poorly managed store with high turnover (lots of greenpeas is a bad sign). They deserve to get roasted in your review.[deleted]Kia dealerships are so bizarre.  It is like a bunch of frat guys negging you to sleep with their weird financing.  I don't think they even sell cars when you go just financing.This one time at a Subaru dealership when I couldn't find a single pre-owned car I wanted on their lot (the car I saw online they just sold apparently), they resorted to numerous tactics to get me to stay and look at various cars of their choosing.

Their final tactic as I was walking out the door?

"I haven't sold a car this month yet I have kids to feed."

Not. My. Fucking. Problem.Woah. Had a very similar experience trying to drive a Stinger. Walked up and looked at one they had sitting on the lot (total of 4 that day), salesman approaches me and does the standard greeting. Asks me "What can I do to get you in this car today?", well, driving it would be a good start. "No problem! Let me make a copy of you license and I'll grab the keys". Cool! 

Guy comes back a few minutes later without anything in his hand and asks me to come inside. "I'm just getting everything approved by my manager before we start anything, come inside and meet him!". Um, no. I just want to drive the car. "Ok, be right back" (Still don't have my license back)

Comes back a few minutes later, still no license. "My manager says we're going to need to see some proof of funds because its a showroom car before you can test drive it, come inside and we can work this out". LOL. Its a Kia, not a new Ferrari. I declined the offer, and asked for my license back. Gave me the run around for a  bit before he finally went back into grab it. Made the mistake of giving him my phone number as I left and I'm not kidding when I say the dealership called me 10 times over the next 4 days, texted twice. Almost all during business hours, even after I'd asked them to quit contacting me. 

For what it's worth, I'm a young dude, but I dress reasonably well and present myself well. Whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth, and I was really looking forward to driving a stinger as a potential next car!Went with my sister to help her look for a new Kia in the DFW area. 

Among many other problems they had,

 - they kept our drivers licenses-

They brushed us off the first couple times we asked for them and when we finally got out and were ~15 miles away we realized they still had our damn cards.

They still fought us when we went back. The freaking nerve. She ended up buying at a car max style place and it was a much better experience. I would have called the police after my second request to have my car keys returned.  I wouldn't have even said a damn thing, just gotten the police on the phone and told them that the car dealership was attempting to steal my car.    

I had some car salesman try to hold my keys as hostage once.  I did not react the way he was expecting, and the Knoxville TN Police became involved quickly.  

The shitty part was that I had bought a brand new WRX from them a year and a half earlier and had had a great experience.  I should have heeded the giant red flag that went up in my head when they told me the salesman and sales manager I had worked with weren't with the dealership anymore. That sounds ridiculous and I kinda wanna go to a KIA dealership to see what it's like now...hmm...maybe that was the point of this post. I see what you're doing KIA shillsYou mention Canal St NYC, This wouldn't happen to be a Kia store in the Westchester area would it?Literally how the Toyota dealership I worked at for a little bit was like.  We were trained to force buyers into a car, bring them to a deserted area for them to test drive their OUTLANDISHLY SPORTY COROLLA S and upon returning to the store force them inside and drop them off to a closer.  Management had listening poles on the lot where the salesmen were stationed (in Florida during 100F+ and rain) and if you didn't say the nonsense they trained you to say you would either be A: immediately terminated or B: reprimanded and scolded that you will never amount to be a closer or anything in the facility.  

"Facts" were to be crafted upon the desires of the customer wherein you must pluck 2 key values they are interested in and completely blow mandatory features on cars out of the water to glorify the brand.  

Maybe I'm just salty that the GM and his 2 sons, who were 1 tier below him on the powerchain, were racist, moneyhungry pigs but still made bank doing literally nothing.  In that time, I learned quickly that I am not cut out to climb the corporate ladder of a giant such as Toyota but to fix business power struggles as a third party company to help the communication between the low tier workers and the decision makers. (I/O psych degree still looking for this type of position please send help) 

Hopefully we can oust dealerships like these of their ability to treat customers like cattle and establish a better connection between consumer and company.

EDIT: I forgot to say -- I mystery shopped at a KIA dealership as part of some training regimen at Toyota and honestly they were super nice people and didn't hound me like everybody else in this thread. Cheers to the dealership I went to I suppose.Can confirm, Kia dealers are massive shitholes. I went into one trying to test drive a Stinger. I walked out 5 minutes later angry. 

After greeting me the salesman asks me "Where are your parents"? I was caught a little off guard by this but I didn't respond. After showing me around the car in the showroom I ask if I can test drive one. He responds by saying "Are you sure you can handle something like this? Do you want to look into something a little more affordable?". I told him I was sure and that I was really interested in this car. He then attempts to steer me over to the Niro in the showroom and suggests I consider it instead. 

I thanked him for his time and walked right the fuck out. 

Edit: Yes I was driving my Z06.I hate it when they try to tell you what they think you want to hear, then the back pedaling they do when they get it wrong.

I was at a Fiat Dealership when the 500 Abarth came out. I was curious about the weight of it. He opens the door, looks at the door plate and proudly states the GVW at something like 3,000lbs. It may be small, but it's a heavy & solid car.  

I say, that can't be right? I was hoping it would be about 2,400lbs, and that was the whole reason I'm interested. He just starts spewing out stuff to try to make me happy. As someone who likes KIA and Hyundai cars, please skewer them and then twist the knife in your review. The last four times I've bought a car the KIA/Hyundai dealerships were my first stop, but never my last stop. Hyundai dealers were just "below average", but with KIA dealers it is like filling the shitty dealership bingo card. The only KIA I've ever successfully purchased was at a Toyota dealer's used lot. A car I would have rather purchased new.

As a secret shopper you should have gone further in the process, it gets worse. Test drive and negotiate for the Stinger GT. Agree on a price and I bet they come back with paperwork for a stinger base model without saying anything and hope you don't notice.You should do an AMA. Interesting job.Poorly managed salespeople seems par for the course with Kia.

My previously leased vehicle, I was cross shopping a bunch of vehicles, one of them being an Optima SX-L. I did not buy one.

I make an appointment with a salesperson, and he is busy when I arrive. I wait. He shows me to an Optima on the floor, base model, and says he'll be right back to pull out the one I was looking for, he just has to show a couple to a vehicle. He is out there for 15 minutes. He takes them on a test drive. I get angry, but go to another salesperson to ask for help. He tells me that he can't help me, as I'm here with [salesperson].

I leave.problem of trying to sell premium/near luxury cars at a budget dealer. you'd be less likely to see this at audi/lexus/bmw/mercoh boy, yeah drop the bomb on them, or at least the douche guyDealer in northern Philly has a k900. I am NOT looking to buy. Coworker bought one. So we go in to pick it up. I give her a ride. She could EASILY buy a Mercedes. I have NO sides why she doesn’t buy a nicer car. Whatever. Mind you. She already bought it and we’re going to PICK IT UP. 

She’s dressed very well. I’m in jeans and t shirt. First people we talk to have no idea the car is even there. They look for it and we are waiting in the showroom and looking at the one on the showroom floor. Going in and out of it. Another salesperson starts chatting her up and then sees me and says “sir, if you want to get in we ask if you can take your shoes off. It’s a luxury car”. No prob. I take them off. Then the salesperson comes back and says they don’t have the car. She says her salesperson called that morning saying it was ready to be picked up. He says who was it. She gives his name. Oooooh. Salesperson gets wide eyed and goes in the back. She follows. Meanwhile I’m playing with the seats and get in the back. Different salesperson starts telling me I need to give him my DL if I want to try the car out. What?  I don’t want to. I’m literally playing with cup holders. I tell him I’m not interested in a test drive. He says “yeah but we have a policy to get a DL if you want to look at a car”. What?  

Coworker comes back. Says the entire sales staff was let go that morning. It’s 5 now. These guys are scrubs from god knows where. They don’t have her car. The GM aid there and is apologizing left and right and then says they will order one for her if she fills out the paparrwork and talks to their finance person. She already paid for it. With a check. It cleared (so she says. Didn’t think that happened till you had the car in hand) but they have NO record of this. Her salesperson was “on vacation” (didn’t he tell you?) and so yeah. 

That was about it. She didn’t come back. Got her money back and is suing (it’s been 8 months since this) to get back some of her money they are billing her for. 

Holy crap. Thanks for your story.

As a non-American I'm curious: why would you ever give your keys to a dealer/salesman?

Is it common practice? What do they do with it? Surely your license copy is enough of a warranty for the test drive for them? Especially when a salesman accompanies you. They should even give your license back before the test ride.[deleted]Now I want to go on my day off coming up and ask to test drive a Stinger, mainly to see if this happens to me and because I am genuinely interested in the Stinger.[deleted]KIA dealerships are just terrible. The stinger honestly don’t deserve to be there..ouch :(

I know your mystery shopping, but there's no way I'd hand over my keys to anybody for nothing.  When I test drove something, they photocopied my license.  I asked for *THAT* back when I left and they were surprised.  "Look, I don't trust you for shit, and I don't what you or anybody having a copy of my license for no reason at at all."  ah the good ole we've got your keys you're trapped techniqueLiterally had the same experience the other week looking for a Stinger.

One dealer would not let me test drive the car unless I committed to buying.  "its a fast car", lol.

Another dealer was perfectly okay with test driving - admittedly had to wait a couple days as they only wanted to test on good weather (in canada).

I mean in the end, the best dealers are gonna make the sale, so i don't really fret about it.Concur. Bought a Kia. Actually had a great sales staff and we love the car but the finance department was scum. i need to buy a car in about a year...not at the moment but soon-ish. Stinger GT was sorta/kinda/maybe on my list of things to check out because of the warranty. I probably will end up going with a wagon or small SUV (2019 volvo v60 mmm mmm) but I was planning to at least test drive the Stinger. 

If it's going to be a giant fucking nightmare to do that I'll just pass since it was near the bottom of the list anyway.My girlfriend had the shittiest test drive experience out here in San Jose trying to look at a Niro. She had a soul and loved it and kia and they single handedly destroyed her want to buy a kia from that dealership. 

in 30 mins the sales guy (who was obviously new, and dressed poorly as well)

-proceeded to talk to me about what she could get on the car and about the car's features, ignoring her. i had no control over what she was buying dude! i said so! 

-texted the whole test drive in the back seat. there were minutes of silence.

-didn't tell her where to go, despite her asking him to specifically

-attempted to adjust the seat to help her get more comfortable without seeming to know how seat adjustment works (she is very small)


She was really uncomfortable at the end and we left quickly. I've been on a lot of test drives and worked at dealerships, that was bottom tier. it really even turned me off considering a stinger. I had someone tell me that I shouldn't be comparing my Kia experience to the experience I had with Audi, which has got to be the single shittiest insult you could give to Kia. Yea, I just dont get why Kia would allow this to happen (and maybe they working toward NOT allowing it to happen, but currently it obviously still is). 

It's one thing to try and use sketchy and cliche car salesman tactics on the soccer mom shopping for that $17k Kia Soul or something (still wrong and incredibly douchey, but still...), but it's a tactic that just plain WILL NOT work on the crowd shopping for $40-50k entry-level luxury vehicles. It will ONLY provide a negative experience to someone who is capable and willing to spend that much on a car. Mercedes, BMW, Lexus, etc would all be failing companies if they used these kinds of selling strategies regularly.

I don't believe Kia is done making $40k+ luxury/sport cars (they have the K900, Cadenza, Stinger, and loaded Optima's already, and I firmly believe a luxury SUV and an even faster/sportier version of the Stinger are right around the corner), but they will not be successful at all if they dont quickly rectify the stigma their sales and service departments currently have. Similar in Ogden Utah. Came from out of state to look at a minivan.  Salesman pushed us through a number of extras that he couldn't/wouldn't explain. Guy was nearly 50 with years of experience. Once we got to finance, the next kid was pointing at papers to sign but not describing what they were in detail. Just called its name. For example, theft protection and environmental protection charges didn't look the same on different papers. Turns out, the theft deterrent system is just bar codes they stuck on before and claim they can't be removed. And environmental protection isn't a government agency requirement. It's a coating to prevent rust. And they have a flashing light or something that allegedly prevents rear-ending. You have to tell them to take it off. They weren't happy when came back the next day to remove $500+ worth of charges that they failed to explain. I had to Google everything. Not the best way to be "Gephardt Approved" out there. Wow.  Complete opposite to my dealer.  Walked in, basically they said "can i help you?"  I was wearing a touque, cheap sweater and crappy sweatpants.

Just a little chat, sat in the stinger, sales guy pointed out a few features i was looking for (seat adjustment, lumbar support, mirror adjustment, trunk release).  Didn't say anything untrue about the car.  Just helped me get comfortable in the seat.

Test drive, let me take it up the local mountain and highways.

Obviously they mentioned the dealer add-ons like undercoat and rust protection and crap.  I said nope, they didn't bring it up again.

If they were pushy like that, i would have walked out, even though i already had my heart set on the stinger.My parents almost bought a Kia in 2001. I remember the salesman kept calling us and dropping the price on the car After the fact my parents bought a Subaru[deleted]To be fair most non-luxury brand dealerships aren’t that much better.How can I become a mystery shopper? I've always to do itI went to a Kia dealership in my town when they first received the Stinger to get a closer look.  I walked in the dealership and not one person said hi or anything, which maybe wasn't a totally bad thing...lol.  Perhaps they were all just busy with customers at the moment.  

One of my best friends has purchased 2 Optimas in the last four years.  I don't remember him saying anything negative about the sales experience.  On his 2015 Optima he hit something metal on the freeway and it punctured the oil pan and blew the engine.  His insurance only wanted to pay for a used engine, but the dealership stepped up and but a brand new engine in it so he was very happy with the service department.  Unfortunately that car ended up crushed by a tree during a tropical storm so that's how he ended up with a 2017 now.To be fair, I imagine most employees at a Kia dealership are inexperienced and trying to cut their chops.  It's like going to a Chili's and saying "I had a bad waiter"... there are plenty of good ones but it's not surprising that there are a lot of inexperienced people there.  

I'm sure most of them would prefer to be working at a BMW or Lexus or even Toyota dealership but they have no credentials.  This probably leads to an *insane* turnover rate at these dealerships (lots of bad salesmen who don't make it; good ones get better jobs quickly) and it's probably next to impossible (not to mention expensive and likely not worth it) to make sure they're all properly trained and actually good at their jobs.> “has a manual transmission” (points to paddles)”,

Oh so he's every craigslist seller with a tiptronic system.Having helped a bunch of friend purchase new cars, I've found that the cheaper the car, the more shithole the dealers tend to be. Most luxury dealers didn't really play much games, sure they'd fudge the money factor a bit and what not, but nothing like selling someone a Civic for $27k OTD when the MSRP is $20k...I've heard things like "the car doesn't have an alarm system so you must buy it" which is ~$2k, protection packages, vin etching, etc. It's awful. And there's always two "levels". You deal with the salesman first, and then the finance manager that tries to mark up other shit again. The finance manager actually got mad at us cause we didn't want their shitty Karr alarm system when my uncle got his accord. Not to mention the shitty install is now causing issues because of monkeys that installed it.


My aunt was trying to buy a base model frontier which is $18k. They were gonna buy it outright, but the dealer said, put $10k down and finance the rest. Payments came out to $300/m for 4 years. Some people would just say "okay" and sign the papers; when you can easily check 300*48=$14.4k+$10k=$24k. Much more than the $18k they negotiated. So I am ASE certified, used to work for GM went through their training, was with them for almost 7 years.
Wife is like. I am pregnant, we need a bigger car.
So... I don't take these decisions lightly.
Took the next 6 months figuring out what to buy.
There is a history of me even asking advice here on reddit.
One guy said get a used Honda Element it was not bad advice.
Anyway we decided that the 23K mitsubishi outlander had every single thing on our checklist that we wanted out of a car for our family to travel long distance.
I don't buy new cars.
So we go into a mitsubishi dealership and say we want THAT car right there. Pointing to a red mitsubishi outlander 2017.
 And we want to pay 16K for it.
The salesman spent 20 mins bragging that he was the best salesman in all of mitsubishi. Then he pulled around a BLACK with black interior 2018 outlander.
I was not amused. They claimed they could do this weird financing thing and we could leave that day paying 18K for that brand new less than 100 miles 2018 outlander.
I called the mitsubishi dealership down the road and told them 
what was happening.
"oh yes we have one on the lot right now come and get it"
So we leave and go there.
They introduce me to a "used car manager" he says I can get any car on planet earth for you, I just tack on a 1,500 dollar finders fee for getting it here for you to buy.
He showed me a dealers only auction website and picked out some red ones that were in 5/5 condition. They were all about 14-15K.
He said I will order one for you and in a week we will have it no problem, I will just add 1,500 bucks.
Ok then.
Week later they call and say come get your car.
We go inspect it and my wife wants a remote start option installed before taking possession and I want rear rim replaced.
We go back two days later and those things are all good.
Now they try to sale us the car for 19K.
I flip the fuck out, we try to leave,  they tell us they can get rid of the 1,500 dollar finders fee bringing it down to 17,500.
I tell them I said 16K and the other dealerships told me that he would sale me a brand new one for 18K.
They say "yeah but it's longer financing..." they then pretend to call the owner and then say they can get 500 dollars off but any lower and people will get fired.  (yeah sure)
I tell them to throw in an interior detail and exterior scratch restore buff out whatever and they have got a deal.
They agree. I bought the car.

WHY DO DEALERSHIPS HAVE TO JERK YOU AROUND?
Why is buying a car like pulling teeth?

And let me tell you something else. We went to a lot of dealerships and saw a lot of cars. We went to a subaru dealership 3 months earlier and there was a green XV fully loaded in the showroom and I was in love with it instantly. 
I would have bought it right then and there if someone would have just given me the paperwork but the salesperson took me away from it, refused to talk about it and tried to force an outback on me just because I originally asked to see an outback.

I would have bought that xv.




[deleted]I was at a Kia dealer and asked the guy if Kia was made in South Korea... he said, “ Yeah, north or south I don’t know. 

edit: key -> kiaI had an incident after college attempting to buy my first car in a Kia dealership. I had saved a ton of money working a summer job and armed with my diploma, for the good student discount. I was prepared to simply buy a sorento, as that was the company car I used at my office job in college and knew all the specs of the car and really didn’t want to put in the work to test drive a million cars. I needed a reliable car to get from point a to point b. 
When I got to the dealership, I was immediately bombarded. I simply stated how much I had as a down payment and how much I preferred to pay a month. No beating around the bush as there was another dealership down the street. The guy starts pushing me to test drive a brand new different model they “just got in last week”. “Just to pass the time” he says. Obviously the car had all the bells and whistles and on the drive I mentioned again what I came there for. 
His tone immediately changed and DEMANDS I drive back to the dealership. 

Fine by me. 

Pulling in, I asked to see the exact model I saw on the website. “Oh we never had that one...” I call bullshit. It was a brand new model of that year. I tell him we can no longer do business ... he relents and decides to get his “big boss manager”. Manager offers to sell me ANOTHER completely different model and year for just $250 more a month. Uh, no. I’m a broke college student...He immediately slams the car door in my face and flips me off, telling me he no longer wants to work with me. 

I was infuriated and vowed to never buy a Kia just from that experience alone. They even had the nerve to bombard my phone and email with apologies still wanting to do business.[deleted]Yeah, I went to KIA looking to buy a Stinger.

Long story short; I pick up my new M240i on Friday.When I hear that he says its a manual and talks about how good it drives, its obvious he'd already taken some liberties with some of the stock there at the expense of the future owners.  > “it has a BMW suspension”   

It's not entirely untrue, they've sniped quite a lot of BMW's staff these days.    

But that sounds like an overall horrible experience. Had a somewhat similar expierience with my local KIA dealership when looking at a Stinger GT2. The sales guy I was working with was actually pretty good though, he was fairly knowledgable about the car, let me test drive it with no questions asked (20+ miles actually), and was generally a very laid back guy.

The trouble started when we got back to the dealership and we started talking numbers. He wanted my social right away, which I immediately stopped and asked what for. He wanted to do a credit pull before we even talked about the price of the car, etc.

The problem was, they wanted a $5k markup on top of MSRP. I told him I wouldn't let him run my credit until we got that taken care of. Next thing you know, the dealership owner is stopping by. 

I straight up tell him I will buy it today at MSRP (knowing tons of people are getting them below MSRP, but w/e), with no markup. He refuses to budge. Says they are hot ticket items that are made by the former BMW / Audi designer, they are better than BMWs / Audis, they aren't going to depreciate much in 3 years, etc.

I reiterated that if the markup was taken off, I'd buy it right then and there. Still refused to budge, so I left.

A lot of what he was spouting was not true; it seems they're just throwing out random facts like the Stinger is suddenly better than BMWs / Audis rather than letting the car speak for itself. 

I guess this is working for people that don't know cars, but he would have made a sale that day if he had dropped the damn markup. I think KIA is not prepared to sell these cars to enthusiasts that actually research the car as well as have a general idea about the luxury car market.[deleted]Fuck KIA salespeople. My experience was not as bad but pretty awful. Jackass salesman lets me sit in a car for a few seconds then instantly drags me inside and tries desperately to get my personal info to run numbers. He was offering some outrageous lease amount for their cheapest car, the forte, $400/month with $2k down. Riiiiiiiiight buddy. I had to raise my voice to get him to stop and the manager noticed and came over. All the idiot manager did was continue the bullshit speal until I interrupted him to let him know I had not even taken  a test drive yet and what outrageous of a rip off deal his salesman was trying to pull on me. “Wellllll” ... fucking scumbags. Not just Kia dealerships. I worked for a company that had car dealerships as customers.


This "hold your keys, license, car hostage" thing is common. NEVER give those up. They'll offer to wash your car for free, assess it for a trade-in, or move it somewhere you can't find it. Nope. They can make a copy of your license for the test drive. Don't leave it in their hands. Be ready to walk at any time. 

This reminds me of a time I was looking at an RX-8 at a dealership and the guy told me it had a V6 and got great gas milage lol. This sounds more like a dealerships are scum bag situations than a Kia problem. I recently went to test drive a VW Golf GTI and the guy gave me the same type of run around. 

To be fair, two of his claims were accurate-ish. The lead chassis engineer was Albert Biermann, who not only has a fabulous name, but was the head of BMW's M Division for some time.

It is also faster than some supercars.... From the 1980s and 1990s. I work retail and that sort of behavior would get me retroactively fired since 1950.and then there was the day my mom, in her 50's and a NYC commercial real estate broker (think millions) was told to "come back with her husband" for a small sportscar.  They didn't sell.
When you go to a dealership look for a sales person in their 40s or 50s that’s been at it forever, preferably a woman. Doesn’t matter what brand. New or used.

They aren’t arrogant, they aren’t out to screw you. They don’t try to pretend they know everything about cars or get in dick measuring contests. They just want to help you pick a car that works for you, and get their normal commission. If the car you want isn’t the one they have they give you their card and ask you to look them up if you decide you do want something you drove there.

If you end up at a dealership and there are no people in sales older than 30, fucking run man. It means they’re hiring anyone with a pulse willing to do anything to make a sale.I think Kia/Hyundai make a damn good car for the money. The KDM market by and large offers the best value of any automotive segment

Admittedly, high pressure sales tactics and salespeople who try and pretend to know what they're talking about are my biggest annoyances when it comes to buying a car. The whole business about "Turbo supercharged" and "Manual transmission" while pointing to paddle shifters would be enough to make me run far, far away from that dealer. As an automotive enthusiast, that shit irks me to no endI went into a KIA dealership in 2015 with the intention of buying a new car.  That was my ONE focus that day. I knew it could take a few hours but I didn’t care.  I told the saleswoman that the only thing I wanted was to have a lower payment than what I currently had.  

The first car she runs the numbers on is a top of the line $48k Sorento.  Almost double my current payment.  She tried to keep pressing me saying “you deserve this”.  I gave up right then and there and left.  

I mean c’mon how do sales people talk someone out of buying a new car?!  

It’s like they use every old trope in the book.  Like “I like you, so here’s what I can do”.  

Needless to say, I haven’t gone back and I like their cars.  Just a heads-up, this post triggered the salty losers over at /r/askcarsales when it was crossposted there.

https://www.reddit.com/r/askcarsales/comments/82ltjb/guy_mystery_shops_kia_dealer_and_they_get_his_keys/> I show the manager my badge


What badge?The dealership i purchased my stinger was fine. They pulled the car out of the showroom without a second thought, gave me the keys for a test drive. They took 10min to get a trade in value on my car and brought my keys back to the table. My sales guy set me up with a free loaner while my windows got tinted a week later. Overall not the worst place to buy a car, would probably buy again from same dealership.How is it a "test drive" when youre forced to buy the car afterwards? That's such a huge red flag. If any car dealer ever said anything like that to me I'd walk out right then.For what it's worth, I was pretty sure that I wanted to buy an Optima and in less than 15 minutes the Kia dealership managed to completely talk me out of buying a Kia for the rest of my life.This post has motivated me to go fuck with a KIA dealership today after work. Thanks!Jesus Christ. I work in finance at a dealer and was sales for a few years and have never seen anything even close to that go down. The sad thing is that I totally believe your story. I know dealers still pull stunts like that and unfortunately it's not as rare as I would like to think. 

There are plenty of dealers who would never allow that kind of behavior from sales people. I'm very careful about who I work for, which is probably the main reason I'm even in the business still. It makes me sick how many scumbags fuck up the industry for the rest of us. 

After 5 years in the business I've helped at least 1000 customers buy a vehicle either as a sales person or in finance. A large majority have told me, unsolicited, that I helped provide the absolute best experience they have ever had and they are shocked that car buying can be enjoyable and comfortable. 

That's obviously a huge compliment and makes the job very rewarding. At the same time it's really sad how surprised people are when they are treated with respect and offered help and transparency. I do my job and do it well and give good customer service. That's it. That's nothing special at all. I'm not some kind of elite super-human prodigy. 

In the past year I've made at least 10 customers cry because I just did my fucking job and was a decent human being. A few cried because I was the first person to really try to help them when they were in a rough spot. Sometimes they went through a rough patch like a bad divorce or they lost their job and it destroyed their credit and the last three dealers shamed them and treated them like lowlifes. Sometimes they were buying for the first time after the death of their spouse and were terrified of being fucked over and when they weren't the relief was overwhelming. Whatever it was, I never take for granted what I am in a position to do for someone. Fuck people who throw away the opportunity to make an impact like that. 

Sometimes I go a little further to do what's right and sacrifice something small. Maybe I lose $200 or $300 on a warranty or bank fee if it's a huge benefit to the customer. I've lost $500 gross profit to save a single mother $100/month. I cut out all my warranty profit so I could match a bank approval that was 7% APR Instead of 18%. I didn't need to and I don't expect other people to, but I still feel good thinking about it. That's worth a lot more than $75 in commission. I work for people who back those kind of decisions because it's less money now, but comes back tenfold. If I can do things like that and still have higher than average numbers and still bring home bigger paychecks, then I'm doing something right.


I went way off track there, but it feels good to remember why I do what I do. For every person I help, there's just as many problems. Bounced checks, stolen socials, fake ID's, fraudulent credit applications, dodged calls, endless lies, whatever. But it's not that bad at the end of the day. It's nothing compared to people who actually dedicate themselves to make a difference in the world. I guess what I'm saying is that you literally don't need to do anything at all to make a huge difference. You just have to not be a shitty person. There's no advantage to any of those fucking games and there's no excuse. 

My biggest personality flaw is directly related to my best. I have a major anger problem. I'm known to go off and read my sales people the riot act if they piss me off. I don't take shit and I won't accept excuses. But the ONLY things that I ever get angry about are dishonesty and bad customer service. You can back a truck in to my car and spill paint on my Jimmy Choo purse and I won't raise my voice and will accept a sincere apology. But if you refuse to test drive someone before running their credit because you don't "think" they can buy the car, then I'll gladly correct the apparent misconception that your age, attire or career makes you better than anyone. Usually in a way that's a little more abrasive.... A lot more abrasive actuallyThere’s a Kia dealer near me who just yells into the radio and constantly cuts off his wife saying it’s “HUGE-A!”...he seems litToyota did this shit to me when I went to look at their top model Camrys. Held my keys hostage, and "lost" my car (they parked it behind a small building). Fuck dealerships who do this shady shit.This is pretty much what I went though, though a little less intense, when I bought my Si and when I went to look at the 2018 Accord. They do almost anything to keep you on the lot. Hell, when I went with my wife to look at the Highlander they were dicks about my credit and then didn’t want to give me my keys back when I (truthfully) told them I had to go home and take **heart medicine**.

With the Si they kept making shit up or talking about crap I didn’t care about. With the Accord the guy actually left me alone because I was telling my wife the sales pitch. Still you could tell he didn’t want me to get away.

I will most likely be using a car buying service for my next purchase. Probably USAA’s. It’s not worth the nonsense.I once had a salesman try to hold my keys hostage. I called the police non emergency number asking to make a complaint of being held against my will. They got my keys back to me right quick. [deleted]Car dealerships suck. I just bought a new pickup and was told repeatedly they had to run numbers with me to make me aware of my options, I was paying cash outright. Stupid bastard lost a sale because he wouldn't just sell me the truck.I think this is why Tesla is so appealing: There's no dealerships.I scrolled thru the commwnts and didn't see this. This is entrapment. This is used by dealerships to try to pressure you into a sale. CALL THE COPS. Press charges on everyone involved. 

I sold cars for a hyundai and ford dealership for a while and they have training regarding this. They tell you that if you plan on keeping your job don't do any of these actions.This is pretty much every car dealer experience I've had in my life besides at a Mercedes dealer. Maybe it's a "classy" establishment, but every dealer I've been to for the lower end has been just like this. Honda, Ford, Kia, Dodge, this is why I hate the dealership experience. Mercedes (shopping for used) was pretty much "tell me what you want, if we don't have it come back when we do" but not in a bad way, and there was pretty much zero pressure, didn't ask for social or stupid things like keys (which I wouldn't give even if they asked) no talking us into a different car "well this one is beige, that's pretty much silver" none of that. Genuinely fine experience.It's really annoying when dealers put "manual transmission" and its a fucking game of "lets see if they put a pic of the shifter to see if they're bullshitting me or not".

Like, could it kill you to just call them paddle shifters? They're not bad. They're just not manual cars.I'll start by saying thank you so much OP for posting this experience and getting the rants going!

My SO and I purchased our first Kia Rio 5 in 2013 and have NEVER experienced a company worse than Kia when it comes to customer service.

I am so glad I have this great opportunity to rant as well.  Our nightmares NEED to be shared with the rest of you.

As a prelude to the lengthy next bit that's about to come, I will say this; I want Kia to disappear! That's how terrible of a company they are.

I will lay out as many of our bad experiences that I can remember in chronological order leading up to the very recent and most defining last one.

1. Bought our car in early January 2013. Financing option wasn't the issue at all. The car came with factory installed tint. A welcome touch (or so we thought). We also bought the extended bumper to bumper warranty (8y, 160k).

2. Within a month, the rear right bumper reflector lens falls out without any known impact.  I take it in and am charged over $200 to replace.

3. A week later I am called by the dealer and asked to come in for an unscheduled minor recall issue.  Turns out my car didn't come with the right floor matts.

4. A week or two later the aforementioned tint starts peeling off the driver window.  I schedule an appointment to bring it in. They tell me the tint guy is outsourced and can only perform the service on Saturdays when they open (7 or 8 am).  I get there only to find out the tint guy is late.  I wait 2 hours and he never shows.  The GM apologizes and tells me he will get the tint guy to come to my house and do the job outside. I doubted him right away (it was winter) but for some naive reason, I gave him the benefit of the doubt.

5. Later that week the dealership calls me to confirm my thoughts. The tint guy can only do it at the shop AND I still need to accommodate his schedule.  I come in again and leave the car to get the tint done.

6.  When the job is done I ask if all the windows were redone and am told there is no need. One of the salespeople says eight to me that that is BS and I should expect more tint to peel. The dealer still won't do anything unless something else peels.

7. Less than a month later 2 more windows start to peel. Also, the manual transmission seems to be making a weird sund when in low gears.

8. I bring the car in unscheduled on a weekend and while waiting for the dealer to bring my car in for service, the GM finds me and asks me why I'm there again.  I bring him to the car to show him and he right away tells me I have a lemon or a bad luck car. He reminds me that I originally wanted the higher trim model (SX) and in black (I settled for some ugly orangey color). When I had originally purchased, those options weren't available but that day, the exact one I wanted was sitting on the lot new.

9. The GM gets me out of the old into the new the same day.  This was my first/second car purchase and unfortunately I wasn't diligent enough when making the switch. I hadn't realized until it was pointed out to me a couple years later, that the GM had burried the negative equity off the trade in right into my financing agreement.

10. I ask the GM for a $500 gas card for everything I've been through and he agrees I deserve one but says there is nothing he can do about it and suggests I call Kia Canada (yes this was in Canada. A bigger hint is that it was in Ontario), and speak to the customer experience department.  He even tells me to involve him and he will back me up.

11. I call Kia Canada and tell my story to the correct department.  My case is instantly escalated to the head of this department.  She and I spend days going back and forth arguing as she investigates the case.  She eventually even acknowledges that the GM made the suggestion and stands by me but still says no. She and the GM start "battling it out" until the GM returns to me and says he can't help.  Its basically out if his jurisdiction.  He tells me to call back one final time and put up a real fight.

12. I call the head of the customer experience department for all of Canada and at this point she is so frustrated by our week long back and forth a that she ends it with a final......"FUCK OFF!". You read that right. The head of Kia Canada's customer experience department spewed those words out and put the nail in the coffin with that.

13. We decided to move on and just enjoy our new car.

14. About 8-9 months into ownership, one exteremly cold winter night after working outside for 8 hours (valet parking for an event), the car konks out about 1km from my house. I push it all the way to our driveway and use our seemingly fantastic warranty to have the vehicle towed to the dealer. To avoid going through the headaches we suffered with the last car, I have it towed to a different, much further dealer.  Someone I knew who also owned a Kia and agreed the dealer I bought the car from stunk, said he'd had much better experience with this one.

15. I go to the dealer and find out that the yaw rate sensor and one other sensor were malfunctioning and not allowing the fuel to make it to the motor.  They would have to be replaced but were not in stock. So now leaving the car this far away and not being able to come home with it the same day seemed stupid.  So I had them bring it back to the original dealer to make my life easy.

16. Once it gets to the other dealer they indicate that the entire diagnosis needs to be done again because each dealer is independent and regardless of the results they share, it must be done by them. FINE!

17. Over the next few years I tried avoiding all dealerships for all regular maintenance and was pretty successful in doing so. However, eventually, I began to notice the fuel consumption increasing drastically. I tried 2 other Kia dealers in my area in my endeavour to find a good one and experienced the same crap eevrywhere.

18. As well, over the years I've had to replace the backup camera and entire NAV unit as they too became defective.

18. When it came to the fuel consumption issue, that battle was lost when the head mechanic showed me a chart created by Kia that showed that there was an acceptable range for fuel consumption and my car was still in it. The range was ridiculously huge and once again, Kia got their way.  Today, I get an average of 330km to a tank.  I barely drive it for the last 18 months though on the count of working from home since.

19. Fast forward to about 1 month ago.  I went to my dealer because the transmission was slipping, the rear left caliper was leaking, and both shock bushings were worn and needed replacing.  I found this out while getting a safety check which I obviously did not pass. If anyone is wondering, yes, I have been 1000% on top of all scheduled maintenance.  As well, I thought to mention that both front seatbelts were no longer retracting and the drivers side door and gear shifters paint had been coming off over the years. I was hoping all this would be covered by my amazing warranty.

20. I come in for the diagnosis and they tell me that my warranty is 3rd party and not offered by Kia anymore. They aren't sure what it covers by they believe it is the best one and even better than their current warranties.  The first thing they discover is that there is a $250 deductible per claim. So, to avoid having me make 2 separate claims, they indicate that the first plan of attack is to perform a transmission fluid flush to see if the slipping goes away. If after a week it seems okay, then they will put the claims in without the transmission. However, if after the flush nothing changes, they will submit with.

21. I show them the exact maintenance schedule I've been following that was provided to me by them when I first bought the car and point out that it does not indicate my car ever needs a flush.  They say I'm actually about 40k km past due but it won't affect my warranty because I was in fact never told this is required.  They charge me the usual dealer rip off rate to do something my car apparently didn't need.

22. The issue goes away and after a week of driving the car, I call the dealer back to tell them to file the claim without a transmission job.

23. The dealer gets back to me a week later and indicates that the caliper and shocks are covered but not the seatbelts or paint. Great warranty! If mine is one of the best, how does it get worse from here?

24. I bring the car in for the warranty work and this is where things get so sour, we posted a Yelp review about this experience.  Now you get to hear about to too!  This next experience was the deciding factor of whether or not we renew our loan agreement after maturity this April and enjoy the extended warranty until the km run out or buy something else.I'm driving at night on a rural road. There's a car going the other direction with lights so bright that I can barely see. I flash my lights. Turns out that he didn't have brights on. As a revenge, he turns them on. They shine brighter than a thousand suns. I go blind.

I played myself too many times this way.> The recall involves F-150s from the 2018 through 2020 model years that are equipped with optional LED headlights. The problem stems from the headlight switch software. When drivers turn on their low-beam headlights manually, the switch fails to also dim the truck’s daytime running lights. As a result, both are illuminated at the same time, so the lights can be too bright for other drivers, increasing the risk of a crash. This problem doesn't occur when the switch is left in the “Auto” position.Now do the Super Duty with it’s 4 headlights#[ ——— ]You know whose lights are actually really bright? Current gen Hondas. Civics, Accords, Odysseys, they are all freaking bright. And Teslas.About fucking time. I legit lose years off my eyesight whenever one is behind me at night.If people are flashing their brights at you then you should get the headlight alignment checked.Besides f150's; i find the '17+ Silverado headlights blinding.That’s funny, I’ve never had an issue with the F-150 headlights. But the F-250/350? Holy crap. What’s the deal with [these quad headlights?](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tY0GpvPshUo/maxresdefault.jpg) How and why do these exist? I thought vehicles can only have 2 headlights, not 4. And also, they’re bright as fuck.[deleted]**I have a serious question - are our eyes less sensitive to the slightly yellowish halogens?** 

Because I get legit blinded by the newer bluish white headlights. And if it is on a pickup truck, then I am done for driving a sedan. It's gotten so bad that I have sometimes stopped taking a 2 mile shorter backroad to my house at night, and would rather take the longer route and stop at a light rather than being blinded several times on the way home.This might be an unpopular opinion, but having driven many newer cars with factory LED headlights, I vastly prefer the stock HIDs in my TL. They just seem to spread the light so much better without blinding everyone else.Isn’t this the same truck that failed to get an IIHS top safety pick because of the headlights not being bright enough?Remember when car headlights weren't as bright as all the suns in the galaxy combined.Best thing about my new Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV is how good the LED headlights are... but even better, they have a headlight adjustment inside the car with 5 different levels.  People flashing you a lot?  Just lower it one or two points.  Carrying a lot of people or a heavy load, lower it a few points.  Highway driving by yourself?  Crank it all the way up.

All vehicles should have this.There legitimately needs to be legislation regulating the brightness of new car headlights (and retroactive,  if i had it my way)As someone that drives a low and small car. I hate almost every new SUV or Truck on the road with their headlights blinding me through through my mirrors.FUCKING FINALLY ITS STARTING. I have a condition where I have very large open pupils that dont close all the way. This gives me great night vision but also makes it insanely hard to see when these new headlights hit me. I end up blind for a few seconds half the time. Never was a problem till these new bright lights started happening the last few years. Those and the white hallogen or whatever they are lights.TBH there needs to be a new luminosity cap on headlights because if Honda's aren't too bright i don't know wtf the cap is at currently other than "brighter than the sun" as a description.Remember years back, where we would all put HIDs in reflector housings and be considered giant assholes because of the glare?

The OEMs have outdone us. Both my 80s and 90s Ford trucks have HIDs in them, and they are downright easy on the eyes compared to new cars!Yeah, I drive a really low car..Had to get my windows tinted very dark in order to not get blinded.i walk the dog late at night along a fairly busy road and have to look down at the ground because some cars on coming lights are just retarded bright to a point if im looking at them its irritating and its washes out the surroudings.

&#x200B;

I also have illegally dark tints on my car and its been the first time i have not had any issues with other car lights bouncing from my mirrors into my eyes at stop lights etc. which has actually been a really refreshing change.

&#x200B;

edit: also some lights are so bright i noticed it washes out the blinkers until you get really closeI feel like bright lights in general are a trend nowadays and it is annoying as fuck. Can't see shit at night with more than 3 cars behind me or coming my way.This needs to apply to the F250's as well. Damn trucks are searing my retinas!And I thought people weren't dimming their lights.Great, please do the Chevy Equinoxes next.I’ve got the previous gen f150 which also has crazy bright LEDs. 

I’ve adjusted the aim on them so they’re below the side mirrors of the car in front of me at a stop. I also run parking lights as DRLs to be less annoying. 

A lot of guys have these highly glaring LEDs with levelled truck too, and they don’t bother adjusting the aim, and they blind everyone and enjoy it. While they’re at it, 24/7 fog lights too.[Everybody liked that]Fuck yes they are, almost all new cars seem to be this wayWell Christ on a stick, I guess there *is* a God!Cue the most widely ignored recall in history.Headlights being too bright is a serious issue.  If a driver in oncoming traffic cant see, you're more likely to be hit than if you had more reasonable headlights.  I'm not a fan.I have a halogen equipped 2019 F150 and the leds are the one option I wish I had on my truck.  The headlights are so bad when I first used them, I thought they were broken.  It is like holding two bic lighters in front of the truck.FUCKIN NICEIt’s about fucking time!Low beam brightness is getting ridiculous with all manufacturers.I had assumed being a douchebag was a design feature of the F150This needs to happen more. It's honestly getting insane.As a trucker, thank god. Half the time when someone is blinding me from behind it’s just an F series.Good. Tired of being blinded by new cars. The F-150 is far from the only offender.Recently I’ve been wearing sunglasses at night and it’s done wonders for my eyes. Yeah the darks are darker but the brights are so much more bearable.T H A N K,,, F U CK I N G GOOODDDDTwo different times, I have actually flashed my lights in my patrol car at these stupid trucks because I felt like I was staring into the sun as they passed. Pretty sure I felt heat one time. Absolutely ridiculous. It’s actually very dangerous and Ford dropped the ball not checking this stuff. How does no one notice the running lights weren’t switching off?! That would make me feel super confident buying one of these 60k train wrecks. Glad they are having to fix this.Ford finally does something too wellOh... sure!  Pick on the F-150.  *squints at Toyota Corolla Factory LED headlights.

I blame the NHTSA for their headlight rating system, I think Ford said... ok, you want good headlights!!?  How’s the power of 1000 suns?I think that a lot of commenters may have not read the article, because they're "too bright" based on the assessment of "Daytime Running Lights are on simultaneously as LowBeam", not in regards to LowBeam intensity.Possibly unpopular opinion:

This recall should be expanded to include more years, more models and *more brands*.Thank God. Every time I have a night class, I'm blinded by these damn things in particular.I don't think brightness is an issue, they just need to be aimed / adjusted properly off the lineAlso 2019 f-350, mine was recalled for the same reason.In the meantime, those yellow tinted "Night driving" glasses do actually help in my humble opinion.THIS!  Also for people who have these death trap headlights and then decide to lift their vehicle, please adjust your headlights properly! My fiancé got in a bad wreck because someone’s lights on the other side of the interstate blinded her since they didn’t bother to adjust them after getting their truck lifted.Apparently nobody in here has had a newer F250 or F350 drive behind them or towards them.

Those LED headlights are like 8bn candlepower and seriously dangerous.YES. FINAL-FUCKING-LYDucking finally! Damn near blind in my left eye as a result of these fuckers!Thanks. Now do it with literally every other truck, please.Number of truck owners getting \*THAT\* fixed, ZERO.This made me so happy. There needs to be a test and a ticket given out for cars which exceed a certain number of lumens.Its a voluntary recall none of them will get it done.ITT: Reddit pretends it knows more about LED headlights than the car industry as a whole, ignores the real reason of the recall to discuss LED headlights being too damn bright."Thank fuck" - civic guy. Not by choice but by affordabilityGonna hop on to say STOP PUTTING GODDAMN LEDS IN YOUR HEADLIGHTS IF THE CAR STARTED WITH INCANDESCENTS.

the mirrors and lens used to diffuse the light are design with these types in mind. LEDs emit different light strengths at different wavelengths, putting an LED in an incandescent makes your light dangerously bright. It's also illegal in most countries, though rarely knownRecall every suv every car with their new LEDs cuz they're so dam bright. Also car brands shod stop selling auto high beam dmmart adjust type tech because dumbasses leave the car in high beam and these systems aren't that smart imhor/notbaldtires[removed]But can Ford fix the problem where 75% of F-150 owners do not use turn signals to change lanes?That’s everyone’s car in the USA goneHow the hell is this the only car being recalled for that ? BMW learn from this shit ( yes your shitty minis too BMW)But what do I do when someone behind me has their high beams on and has no fucking clue and is literally just blinding everyone in front of them?I’m in Georgia where everyone drives a jacked up truck and they purposely put the brightest lights in that they can and drive 1 millimeter from your rear bumper and flash them at you.  Don’t expect anyone here bringing in their truck for this recall.I agree that these lights are too bright, but I doubt many people will go to the shop to have their headlights dimmed.Finally!!!I am so glad to know that it isn’t the drivers fault. Even just yesterday I wanted to run one of the f350s off of the road. Damn those things are bright. It had just turned dusk so I bet they switched the lights on themselves.There has to be some range rovers with this to. It's either the range or it's another type of Ford SUV. Always getting blinded by some modern SUVsI live in the middle of bumfuck no-where, and I mean almost everyone has an F series, lifted. Every night I get flash banged by some F series, then I feel bad for driving our F series at night because some poor dude in a honda civic is getting flash banged trying to stay on the already fucked up roads we have. I mean, personally I’m used to it, but yeah they are pretty fricken bright.It's almost every new car

I bet all major car manufacturers are spending money to keep the complaints buried 

Just another way money buys you convenience at the expense of others 

Anyone have a petition I can sign?Fuckin finally, I swear this trend of making headlights brighter than a hundred Suns had got to end. As someone who drives a coupe it's goddamn terrifying to be blind for several seconds on a dark highway in the middle of nowhereThank God I thought I was oversensitive or something! These trucks hit lower vehicles so bad it's so obnoxiousThank God!About bloody time.I could have fucking told you that.

Hopefully all the other manufacturers follow suit.Good.  Now if they could position them correctly too, and not at eye level of a driver in a standard vehicle.It's about goddamned timeTHANK YOU.Jesus fucking Christ thank God. This shit drives me nuts. Their head lights need to be bannedWe are looooong past the point of "too bright"
Every modern car is brutal. My pitiful Ranger can barely light up 10 ft in front of me.

Driving with those bright headlights is fantastic though.It’s about time!I’ve read that the law is by wattage and now that there are LED’s and others there are more lumins now. So the law needs revamping to fit new standards.

Damn some new cars are hella bright, and while I was a jeep guy at one point, fuck you jeep guys, oh H3’s in there, blind everyone! Mostly pavement pounders around my parts anyway.Good it's a hazardI've decided my next car is going to be a truck simply because I want to be higher off the ground and not be as blinded by headlightsI'm glad I'm not the only one noticing that, those C-shaped Ford pickup lights are too damn bright.Most trucks light only seem bright because of their height. Them Toyota lights are bright.Thank fucking god, from someone who drives a low car these lights burned holes in my retinas at night!They need to approve those fancy European DLP projector [headlights](https://www.engadget.com/2017/09/21/mercedes-digital-light-smart-headlights/) for use here in the US.I thought I was getting old and my eyesight was failing me. I’m 34.

I have the solution! 

If they are behind me I position my side mirrors so it reflects their light back into their eyes. 

I always have eggs in my car for the asshole going the other way.

Side note: I heard if they get caught with off road bar lights on while being on the road, the police will give them a fine for each individual bulb that is on. This gets hella expensive!Not sure if you the US have them but in Europe the new Minis with the brand new headlights (circular design) are absolutely blinding and aimed far too high.Thank fucking god! I drive a challenger so I already sit low and EVERY time trucks roll up behind me (not just Ford) and they have LEDs I'm blindThis is every new car. New Toyota Camry headlights and any Lexus are insanely bright as well.It's about fucking time. They're usually not adjusted properly, either, but the same can be said of a lot of vehicles I encounter on the road.Auto manufacturers jumped on led tech as fast as they could and went super nova with the brightness. The laws have yet to catch up. We need nationwide regulations to ban the new brightness levels and force recalls to cut most of the new lights brightness down to about 20-30 % of what they were sold as. 

It’s just absurd anymore. The combine of super bright lights and every vehicle being taller is bad enough. As a slight incline or offset and everyone gets blinded by this crap.Gm next pleaseWhy are these bright lights not illegal in other cars for fuck sake nothing like being blinded by the light of a thousand suns and nearly crashingOh shit it’s the lights!! I thought it was the blaring of small dick energyF-150 isn’t the only model that needs an adjustment, Ford isn’t the only brand.Holy hell thank god. Idk if any states do this, but I’ve been saying NJ needs to start inspecting headlights during state inspection. Angle and brightness...far too many people have blinding headlights. There's a car going the other direction with lights so bright that I can barely see. I flash my lights. Turns out that he didn't have brights on. As a revenge, he turns them on. They shine brighter than a thousand suns. I go blind.Feels like every new car has lights that are too bright.A light bar on the car is the solution guys. Turn it on whenever someone is trying to blind you from the front, blind them instead.Imagine having them directly behind you in the rain headlights bright as hell fire trying to go 80 I fucking hate em all of em lolThey ironically don't even have that great of throw for the f150 drivers, they're just hoisted up high and pointed directly in the eyes of anyone in a car.Can they do something about the bell ends that put the million candle watt light bar on the front of their trucks?But they can’t recall the 5.0 engines for piston slap, timing chain rattle and oil consumptionAbout time, trucks sit higher off the ground and if new cars are able to blind drivers then trucks really would too. 
Most states have laws protecting drivers from vehicle modifications that place headlights, taillghts or bumpers too high off the ground. So if a lifted truck is blinding you, call the cops.Pretty sure they were going to get some Ebay HIDs anyways. Just saved them the time.FinallyTHANK YOU!!!not only too bright but way up high so they are pointed right at your rear window and mirrors.Another issue is height and where they're directed. Even regular lights fuck me up in the rear view when they are 4 feet high and not pointing downward.I think all cars since 2016 or so should be recalled for this. Can't see jack shit at night if anyone's driving anything larger than a coupe/sedan.I don’t think their turn signals work either. Have yet to see a truck with working directional here in ArizonaTall vehicles with bright lights are the absolute worst thing when you're in a sedanSo when are they going to recall the wranglers?I can totally get behind this. My grandfather had Alzheimers but there was legally nothing the system could do to prevent him from driving because his muscle memory and driving habits over 60 years just allowed him to drive a car like a robot with zero thought. He never knew where he was but they couldn't take his license away because he was still fully capable of operating the car safely.

After getting calls from the police a half dozen times because he would get trapped in a neighborhood and circle the streets for hours my dad had to physically disable his car so he could no longer leave. 

The problem is the current tests are almost completely physical in nature. There needs to be a psychological element at a certain age threshold."You have already supported this petition" 

Uhh, no I haven't? Do I wake up in the middle of the night as an elderly concerned Tyler Durden? This is great news! This needs to be done in America so badly. I kinda think it should be a requirement every time you renew, just the basics. I had to test on all the street signs when I renewed my license last month and I'm 36. Things like blinker, horn, merging, PUTTING DOWN THE FUCKING PHONE should all be tested. Oh are we doing this? Awesome.

I think this petition should include not allowing groups of sneniors released to the road all at the same time. Make them leave dinner or concerts in stages. I think in the U.S it's far too easy to get a license, people don't really understand that they're in control of a 1.5+ ton killing machine. Should be done for everyone everytime you renew your license. [deleted]Only if this also goes hand in hand with increasing the driver training and testing requirements for all new drivers. That would do a lot more to increase safety than this to be honest.

Stories of that 72-year-old bad driver you encountered do not disprove this any more than your uncle telling you "Hey it was warm in February this year" debunks climate change. You shouldn't only care about statistics when they support what you kneejerk believe anyway. 

Reddit's demographics make these statistics hard to accept though, I realize.Is this not a UK thing?

Get off my roads!


**Car Crash Statistics Based on Age**

Teens = Highest Risk Group: For every mile driven, teens between the ages of 16 and 19 are four times as likely to be involved in a car crash
    
Teenage Car Fatalities: 5,000 teens in the 16 to 20 age group die each year as a result of a car crash
    
Teenage Car Injuries: 400,000 teens in the same age group are injured each year in car accidents
    
Disproportionate Population / Fatality Ratio: Teens make up 10% of the population but represent 12% of car crash fatalities
    
Cost: 30% or $26 billion per year in costs are accounted for by drivers under the age of 24
    
Driving Habits: Teenagers are more likely to speed, tailgate and only 10% report wearing seatbelts
    
Teen Male Drivers: Of male drivers ages 15 to 20 killed in car crashes, 38% were speeding and 24% were under the influence of alcohol
    
High Risk Age Groups: People between the ages of 15 and 24 and over 75 are the groups most likely affected by car accidents
    
Senior Drivers: Drivers over the age of 65 are second most likely to die in a car crash
    
Safety Disparity: Despite the fact that older drivers are on average slower, safer drivers, they are more likely to die in a car accident than younger drivers

 
**Car Crash Statistics Based on Location**
    
Rural Danger: There are about 30% more car crash fatalities in rural areas than in urban areas
    
Deer Collisions: About 150 people die and 10,000 people are injured every year due to collisions with deer which roam rural and less densely populated areas
    
Run-off Road Collisions: Over 31% of all U.S. car-related fatalities are caused by vehicles running off of the road, an event more likely to happen along highways or where there is a steep shoulder
    
Newark, NJ: According to Allstate Insurance, people are more likely to be involved in a car crash in Newark, NJ than anywhere else in the nationWhy stop there? There are plenty of people between 16 and 70 that have no fucking clue how they should be driving their car. I say refresher course every time you renew your license.They need refresher courses every 10-15 years in my opinion. The amount of just plain bad drivers on the road grows everyday because our driving standards in the States are terrible compared to the rest of the world. The shameful thing is we think driverless cars are the way out of this problem instead of simply raising the standards for getting a license to drive. The amount of people I see driving who just should not be on the road seems to grow everyday.Here is the correct link I hope.

https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/190793/sponsors/ov9LHXCyphQegkySrIJGood luck trying to argue this with that generation. 'I was a tank drivers in WW2 before you were born sonny!'Absolutely no politician will ever touch this subject because the electoral systems are biased toward retirees.Yeah they need to but maybe 75, my dad is approaching 67 and still working every day, his healths fine etc and he doesent really look over 50. Whereas you get others approaching 70 who are fucked and knocking on heavens door, 75 to 80 is when people start to deteriorate. Good luck, won't happen.  Old people have money and old people vote.How about even younger?!How about a refresher course very 5 years for everyone?  Some of the worst drivers aren't that old.I want a refresher course for all people. They literally change the driving rules and laws but don't teach anybody then act surprised when people make mistakes. I'd take self driving cars first though, I didn't realize how much I hate traffic until I started working from home part time.When I drive, it's not the geezers that are the problem, it's the phone text and talkers. Hell on a biker. Hang the F*** UP and drive!A lot of hate for the oldersters. A lot of anecdotes, many second and third hand.

But is there any actual empirical evidence that older drivers cause proportionally more collisions than young drivers? I'm guessing young drivers are much more dangerous per capita; teens have better reflexes but worse judgment.

No, I'm not 70. I'm middle-aged but have felt this way for decades.Agreed. I've been whining about this to my family for a couple years. You should be tested every couple of years after say 70. Though, it could be a financial burden for low income seniors. Maybe make auto credits or something with taxes. People forget that most drivers over 65 have never taken a driver's test period. They used to just be able to apply at the post office.This is where self-driving cars will make a real difference in people's lives - allowing seniors to retain some independence without endangering the public or themselves. I'm not looking forward to the day I can no longer just hop in a car and go wherever I want whenever I want but I also know the reality is that visual acuity and reflexes start declining after a certain point and at some point, driving will become too much of a risk. Fortunately for me, that point should still be a long ways ahead and by that time, self-driving cars should be ready for prime time. I wish that technology has been available for my grandmother who was still a mentally and socially active person but could no longer safely drive herself around anymore and had to depend on family to get her around or the limited senior shuttles provided by the community. Oh, what a surprise. Redditors (average age: 20.7) wholeheartedly supporting a stupid law that wouldn't affect them. Different day, same story...For those in the US: this is for British law, I visited the link and it said "you are already signed up and we will send you email updates." No clue...,This needs to happen for young adults as well. Too many people don't obey the rules of the road and have no idea what to do if an emergency vehicle is coming up behind them.You can forget a lot about driving since you received your licence. Being old is a big part of the cause but there's a lot of people that can't drive for shit and they're no where near that age.

My personal opinion, every 5 years WITH an accident should qualify you for a retest.
If you go 5 years with solid driving keep on keeping on.How about refresher courses every 10 years for every driver, because fuck me there are some terrible drivers out there of every age As much as I would support this, I doubt it would pass as politcians would likely be too afraid to anger the age group with the largest voter turnouts.I've been thinking about this for a while, I think in order for it to not be political suicide it can't look like it's targeting old people. So I suggest retesting for everyone.

It'd work like this, assuming you're in a jurisdiction where the licensing age is 16 you obviously get tested then, and again at 18. I think the problem with our US System is you're thrown at the test before you have any real experience so in order for anyone to be licensed the standards are comically low. So still give that 16 year their own (possibly provisional) licence, but make them come back two years later and show they can do more than drive around the parking lot and parallel park.

After that, restest *everyone* every five years (so 23, 28, 33, 33, etc). Even if you passed at 18 with flying colors, bad habits still sneak in and there's a lot of "mature" drivers who seem to forget how priority is assigned at a four way stop sign, or how to safely merge. Retesting ensures those rules stay fresh, making the roads safer for everyone.

At 63 begin retesting every other year. Everyone accepts the fact that our bodies eventually aren't as good as they used to be, but we all also think it hasn't effected us too badly. So prove it, retest and prove you still got it.

Failing a test you should have two choices, go without for three months until you can retest or go through an education course and retest immediately after passing the course. It'll suck, failing a test will have serious implications for people's lives and careers. But it won't suck nearly as much as dying in a car crash because someone doesn't know how to check their fucking blindspots. I hope we have self-driving cars before we all get old.Refresher courses/tests should be mandatory every 5 years or so, regardless of age, imo. 

After the age of 70 or so, make it yearly. My only concern is the age cutoff. Is there evidence that a significant spike in traffic accidents occurs at the age of 70? Or is it 73? 75? Pick the age that makes sense statistically. 

This should happen every 10 years after your initial test.  Then at like 50 or 60 y/o it should be every 5 years or something like that.  My sister is 40 and she scares the shit out of me because of how clueless she is.  The tests are way too easy to begin with imo. I would say 50, then repeat at 60, then every 5 years.Can we just have a real drivers test too. And a retest every 5 years or so? There are some shitty fucking drivers out there.. Relatively little bad driving is rooted in knowledge deficiencies. 

A little help might be better than nothing, but attitudes, intentions, conscientiousness, and physical capabilities strike me as far more important. And you can't realistically fix any of those.Honestly I think everyone should be required to retest every 5 or 10 years then take a more extensive test at 70.  The 70+ age group is probably one of the worst but you see a lot of bad driving across all age ranges.Everyone should have to go through a course every 5-10 years depending on their records. The more tickets a person has, the more frequent they are mandated to go through a driver's ed course and is ineligible to renew until they prove they went through the course.Good on you Brits, I wish someone would do the same in USLovely but I'm fairly sure that younger drivers are far, far worse. How about a petition to remove the trillion speed bumps and 20 mph signs painted in the roads ALL over London ? Ffs!IMO we should be retesting all drivers every five years.  Vision and reaction time can decrease to anyone regardless of age.Why does it say I have already supported this petition? I most certainly have not... This is my first time seeing it.How about 80% of drivers?

I drive for a living, and you're all fucking terrible drivers.

Yes, *even you*. *Especially you*.I don't think a course will really do anything. Older drivers that are problematic don't forget the rules so much as they lack the reaction time and ability to appropriately divide attention to drive. It would be much better just to put them in driving simulators and see if they are safe every five years. I think it's also a lot less demeaning than asking cognitively intact 70 year olds to sit through a course about the importance of staying on the right (ok well this is uk so left I guess?) except to pass.I think every 10 years you should have to get some kinda refresher course. Or have people take advanced driving courses.That's not intense enough. You should have to retake a test every ten years until you are 60. Every 2 years after that.The link just auto-signs you up for the petition. I signed it and I'm not even sure what I signed because it auto-did it when I clicked the link. Not cool. At least every other day I have this thought when taking care of elderly patients in the hospital. "Sir is someone gonna drive you home" " no I can drive myself".......as his blood pressure is temporarily controlled but often remains insanely high near potential stroke levels because he doesn't feel like taking his medication, heart arrhythmia controlled for now, lower back pain from degenerative diseases, on their third eye surgery, barely able to turn his neck, with two hearing aids.

Yeah, clearly safe to drive /s 
Why single out old people? There are tons of terrible drivers on the road of all ages. I honestly think everyone needs a refresher course every so often. Like, every 4-5 years everyone should have to re-test. And we need to be stricter about what is passing and not passing. And we need automated cars for those who can't pass.[deleted]In Illinois, medical personnel and law enforcement can ask the courts to conduct an "unsafe driver investigation" when someone is 75 or older and they believe the person to be significantly impaired, physically or mentally.


 It can be very hard for families to handle this on their own with no real "power" or say over an adult. Just a small thought on this, I'm not arguing against the idea, i know my grandmother lost her driving privileges after she hit two parked cars (thankfully).

Once you look at the elderly and start restricting them, then people will start looking at raising the driving age, because the newest drivers are in a higher bracket of accidents as well <- mainly due to lack of experience which just boils down to a catch-22.  

I would actually like a system that is a more rigorous test and defensive driving classes.  Or just get the public transit system built up properly.Fuck 70. Make it 55 or 60.On the verge of driverless cars, and now we're doing this? A little late guys.You should post this in every other automotive subredditMy granddad is one of the best drivers I know and have complete trust in his ability and he's getting up there in age. I also know other older drivers that shouldn't be allowed to drive what so ever.

Thet also need to make that a yearly course for all drivers in America. Middle aged people are honestly scarier than most of the teens I go to school with just because after they do it for so long you get too relaxed and think things only apply to new drivers (turn signal, looking both ways at a stop sign, etc.) 

And while we're at it can we have a mandatory basic car maintenance course? You don't have to be a pro mechanic but everyone should be able to check their fluids and know when it's time to take it in for servicing before it becomes a hazzard for everyone else on the road (breaks go out, loose lug nuts, oil levels, power steering fluid, transmission fluid) Not only making things safer but better for traffic to. It's surprising that this wasn't done soonerFuck, we need this in the States. I was driving behind some ancient lady going 30 in a 45 towards a light that turned red. Instead of slowing down to stop she just sailed through the light in slow motion. It's crazy how often that kind of thing happens with that age groupMy sister was stopped to take a left and got nailed from behind after 25 seconds by a 91 year old driver. Car totaled, lucky she wore a seatbelt.umm, how about 60. 

Fuck, I actually think a drivers license is something that everyone should have to re-test for every 10-15 years. Doesnt seem to crazy to me.In Canada once you turn 80 you need to re-take the driving test every year And here in Denmark where we have this, seniors are petitioning to reverse it. They say it's discrimination, I say it's common sense. Is there a lack of concerned family members in the U.K. or something?  How can we do something like this in America?Personally I think everyone should have to take a refresher on every 10th year cause damn near everyone lacks driving skills as far as I've seen itI personally think everyone should do a refresher course and test every 10 years after one first gets their license. Near where I live 2 women were killed recently, ran over on a CAR PARK by an elderly person It should be a refresher course every decade. If the DMV was seriously revised, I'd say do a refresher course every 10 years. There's way too many shitty drivers on the roadInteresting to see how many lives this savesBecause, as schoolhouse rock taught us, the first step towards passing a law is making a reddit post about it.Old people are such a pain in the ass to teachYa we have that in Canada, after 75 or 80 you take the drivers test every year.This needs to happen in the US.Literally just yesterday, I got run off the road into a ditch by what appeared to be a 80-90 year old driver. She turned directly into us from a stop sign (we didn't have one) and we saw her coming about a second early and laid on the horn. She didn't look back and kept going, so we had to swerve into a ditch at the last possible second. Car took a hard jolt leaving the road and we were unsure as to whether or not she had hit us. She never looked back and appeared to have no idea what happened despite constant horn. Unsure as to whether or not an accident had actually happened, we got back on the road, caught up - she was going about 15 in a 35 - and laid on the horn to get her to pull over and she never once looked back. I presume she was deaf. Called the cops when she wouldn't stop (and oddly, started looping back in the exact same direction she had come from), gave her plate numbers, and they came and took a report but told us there's literally nothing they would do about this. Also, if we swerved to avoid her reckless failure to yield and hit a tree, we would be liable, not her. Wonderful. About to buy a dash cam...This should be implemented with middle aged suburban housewives as well.The other day me and my girlfriend were in her car at a gas station. An old man backed into her front bumper with his silver impala. He just drove away. He didn't leave a dent in her car, only his, so I didn't bother to pursue even though I had the plate.It's a nice idea, but the elderly react to anything that appears to them to be an attempt to take their driving privileges with the same kind of rage and indignation that about half the people in the US have when the topic of gun control comes up.I have to recertify myself every year to show the powers that be, that I still know how a computer works.

Considering that motor vehicle deaths are so high, and the constant complaints from literally fucking everywhere that people drive like idiots, and traffic is terrible, driving refresher courses should be mandatory way more often than once, at a fairly high age that makes no difference. Every 4/8 years, when you renew your license, you should be doing refresher courses. 

Do street signs, defensive driving, inclement weather training, traffic causes, road design theory, whatever else they can come up with to educate people about different driving topics. Can we get something like this in the usa?  Make it safe for everyone and create jobs...... maybeHonestly, I think retaking the written and driver test should be required every 10 years (or let's just say every third renewal license, which is every 12 years for most, if not all states).  No need to single out elderly.  There are a LOT of bad drivers out there, and the reality is most of them are far from elderly.As a Geriatric Social Worker, I can tell you that it is not a lack of knowledge in regard to the rules or the road, but rather a loss of reflexes, reaction time, etc.  A refresher course will not restore lost function in these domains.  I do, however, think re-testing is in order, with forfeiture of licensure as a consequence of test failure.I'd rather it be every 10 years for everyone, maybe not as extensive as this. I get that there are a ton of stories about how old people shouldn't drive.

What I find interesting is that looking back on all of the people I've flipped off driving over the years none of them were older than 50. Food for thought.If this is a petition being circulated by senior citizens, then funny enough I could support it. If its from some kid 18-20 who just got his license then I consider it a douche bag post, by a douche bag kid.

As far as life experience goes every fatal accident that has ever made news in my personal life, was someone between the age of 18-26, with slippery roads, refusal to slow down, and inexperience being the factors in nearly every occurrence.

Also at the age of 67, driving truck for nearly 40 years my old man has been in one accident. A guy ran a red light and T boned his rig, the guy was lucky to survive, he was 25 years old.

When you consider who is in a larger rush in life, senior citizens or the newly crowned drivers, and how much speed factors into accidents, it leaves this petition looking lob sided in its limited view.Why just 70, though? I think everyone should have to pass a road test every five years, in their own car, with an instructor ride-along. And not just a bullshit "go spin around the block" test. If they fall to signal a lane change? Fail. If they futz with the radio while driving? Fail. If they don't turn the lights on while the wipers are on? Fail. You can take it a maximum of once a month, and if you fail, your license is revoked until you pass. 

I'm tired of having to dodge morons on my commute.I think everyone needs a refresher course every 5 years tbhHoly shit this is exactly what I said needs to happen. 3 times this week I've almost been in an accident because an elderly person couldn't be bothered to shoulder check or look both ways before making a left turn. To be completely honest, I feel like everyone should have to pass a driving test every time they renew their license. I think there should be a refresher course every x years.  Make insurance companies pay for it or something.I would actually like to see that people have to take a "What's new" type refresher courses at least every 10 years. Where I live there's been a lot of roundabouts added in the last 10 years, and you can clearly see people, who weren't thought the proper way to drive through them, that do it each in their own way. Some indicate that they'r going to stay in the round about, some don't indicate, some use the multilane roundabouts as a single lane, etc. We now even have an [outwards spiral roundabout](https://www.google.com/maps/@46.0808561,14.5276454,277m/data=!3m1!1e3?hl=en) with lights that is confusing for everyone the first few times.

Oh, and those safety driving courses on wet terrain and slippery surfaces would also be a good idea every 10 years, so people learn a bit more about handling of cars, so they don't do stupid things when in unexpected situations.60.I'm totally up for *all around* higher degree of difficulty in operating a vehicle in public.  It's WAAAAAAY too easy to get a driver's license IMO.  I see people joke about how bad they are, or how they can't figure out how to back up, or rely on the absolute maximum braking power with each stop.
It's not cute or funny when you are operating a vehicle near me or my family.  Make it harder.  Oh wait...that'll cut down on your revenue.  This systems sucks.

Edit:  why isn't a driver's license similar to obtaining building permits?  Sure, the municipality would make more money if they just approved everything with little to no review, but somehow it's been engrained in our culture that building safety is much more desirable than immediate tax revenue. I wish would could apply some of that logic to driving.  "In our state, it's ridiculously hard to get a license.  We have 93% fewer vehicle-related deaths per year than the next closest state"

Something like that anyway.A lot of people say this is ageism and whatnot and because of that, these measures(in the US at least) typically fail. That's why I think a refresher test should happen every 16 years. 16, 32, 48, 64, etc. This will make it more like a normal thing everybody has to do, instead of something that only affects a specific demo.probably should do it every 10 years, at least so its equally annoying to everyone. Can we have a refresher course every 10 years instead for all drivers? that would be swell.Can we get this in Canada also please. I absolutely love and respect our elderly so I want what is best for them. By reassessing their abilities we can remove the poor drivers and empower those that remain while making our roads much safer. 

Additionally, I am all for routine retesting of drivers who fail to meet the criteria set forth by a reasonable transportation department. Wait a second, why does this thing say it's already registered my signature?  I've never signed it, nor would I since I live in Florida not the UK.  If it was Florida I would sign it.I live in Arizona, and my drivers license doesn't expire until I turn 65. I need to get new pictures every once in a while, but still. this makes me think of how a private pilot license works (I'm licensed, but have not flown in over 5 years so correct me if I'm wrong).

For a private pilot license in the U.S. you pass the test and get the license. It does not expire, but if you screw up pretty bad it could get revoked.

However - they have something called a "Biennial Review" (which they keep changing the title of because they don't want it to sound like a test...). Anyway - every two years you are required to meet up with an instructor pilot. He does a bit of ground training with you, answers any questions you have... then, you go fly together for an hour or so. Technically, if he is not happy with your skillset then he isn't going to sign off your books and you can't fly past the two year mark until you get him (or another instructor) to sign it off. So, you are in a sense... grounded. They really try to PUSH that it is not a TEST and that it is an OPPORTUNITY for you to get a bit of training and make sure you aren't doing something unsafe.

In addition, the FAA will allow online training, certain pilot events (a safety presentation, etc) to count as time toward the "ground training" portion of your biennial commitment.

I think this is a pretty good system because it allows all pilots to touch base with a skilled individual every two years and review how they are doing things to make sure they are safe. It also prevents people from letting their skillset decline to the point they are a hazard to others.Just FYI, for US drivers: a patient's doctor can revoke their license based on medical necessity (Dementia/Alzheimer's is a *very* common reason for this). It can be hard on the patient, and doesn't remove the need to physically take a car away in some cases, but you don't need the DMV to administer a test for this. In NYS, this is the DS-6 form."Texting and driving is the equivalent of a 74 year old driver."


THEN WHY IS NOBODY TALKING ABOUT 74 YEAR OLD DRIVERS?


Yeah, that's when commercials stopped using that line.Hell, every 10 years I say!How about making the test harder?

I know a terrible 85 year old driver. He can pass the test no problem.I was told by my insurance agent that my 72 year old mother would need a doctor's permission slip for driving to acquire insurance for her to drive a car (you cannot re-new your license without insurance). So while the "law" maybe lacking in this area the insurance companies have your back.I'm so glad I'm not the only one. My restaurant serves mostly older people who live in the surrounding neighborhood, their whole life they never wanted to drive more than 5 mins from home. Regularly we have people park on curbs, get out see they parked shitty, then just leave it. We had a guy drive over a median and pop all 4 tires and had to get a tow truck to pull his car off the grassy curb. I've seen waiters park cars for people who try 30 times before giving up. And when it comes to Alzheimer's we had a regular who would come in every day, thinking it was 20 years ago and always ask where his friends were, ask you to read his watch for him, and then just get in his car and drive away. People would always stare at me like I was crazy when I would comment how terrifying it was that he was driving everyday. Yeah I can empathize with his condition, but that man could easily have killed someone...

This needs to happen in the US like yesterday
Everyone everywhere with a license should be retested every three to five years. People forget and neglect shit when they become complacent and I can guarantee that people who have been driving for forty years are complacent. People that drive and constantly get into small accidents are complacent. Retesting and retraining people would iron out this complacency. I'd sign that.  I was at the DMV and saw an old 90 something year old lady that was mostly deaf and completely blind in one eye pass the test.  Everyone waiting was looking around at each other like are you effing kidding me?! Very few people would pass a driving test in Ireland and UK over 70.

So are you gonna fund someone to take them to the grocery or doctor? Or fund them having to into a nursing home when they can no longer drive. Everything is linked and stopping old people from driving is gonna result in a lot of collateral costs.Just in time for self driving cars. We have a 94 year old woman who drives in our town. She is really small and can barely see over the steering wheel. Its quite scary to see her drive as she goes around cutting corners and ending up on the wrong side of the road.

I definitely think there should be a re-test for people atleast 70-80I see that south park episode has finally come to life.

"I believe in respect for old people, grandpa, I just don't wanna die."Just have kids that are starting to drive take them to the places they need. They will quickly realize they would rather just stay home.Yesterday I went to Trader Joe's (a grocery store) and right at the exit there was this little old lady parked in front of the exit. Like right in front of it... on the sidewalk. As she was leaving she drive her car into the shelves of flowers and just kept going until she almost hit a person. People then somewhat blocked her from going further forward but instead of backing up like everyone was yelling at her, she slowly crept even further forward...

Not my problem and I have other things to do, but I could help but shake my head and laugh. I mean, if there's no better example of why retesting is important than with this senile old lady. Probably should start at 65Fuck a refresher course. That is as insulting as it is useless. How about a basic competency test? From outside the vehicle so the stupid shit people lose marks for (actual drivers driver habits) don't infuriate people needlessly. Like 'omg you only have one hand on the wehll, minus two points. And you're doing it again, two more points'.We need something like this in the US too, but I think this ought to start at 65.As an employee of an Ophthalmology office this should definitely be a thing. We have pts, all usually over the age of 70 that tell us upon examination their vision is great. Then they proceed to read 20/60 or worse. Have to be 20/40 or better in each individual eye to legally drive (unless there is a medical reason you can't be). It's a lot worse than people realize. And these old folks don't care. At all. Maybe I'm a jerk, but I do what I can to get them to stop driving. Tell them they aren't legal to drive. Tell them that if they have an accident with this vision they are liable. I'll do whatever it takes to get some of these people off the road!Hells fuckin yes. Living and working as a hospitalist in a place where there is a significant senior population I see people that I'm completely flabbergasted are capable of driving. Patients can't manage to find their room in an area where there's only 3 rooms. A gentleman last week was driving despite his families protests, when his vision was checked it was found that he was legally blind. Super scary stuff YES IVE SAYING THIS FOR YEARS!That there are not laws like this belies the terrible nature of elder care in the united states.

Or: the reason why these laws don't come up is partly due to the fact that this would strand the elderly in areas where they can't care for themselves.Won't matter in 20 years... a "course" isn't going to help elders with memory disordersWe just need to take humans away from the controls all together.This may be a good idea for cities with well established, all-encompassing public transportation system. It it isn't feasible for most of the U.S., however, because most of the U.S. is heavily car-dependent, and elderly people are forced to drive because they can't get to the store for food and medication or to the doctor for an exam.I like this... Can we add a part where every Memphis resident has to do this once a year?This is something I've been clamoring for the U.S. to do as well, maybe even at a younger age. I wish we would.I'd support this but truthfully, we'll probably have self-driving cars before this passes.Eyesight and cognition fades in some people much sooner than 70. I strongly believe that starting at age 50, a person should be able to pass a quick eye test and pass a quick driving course in a simulator/their own vehicle. The simulator or road course should focus on reaction time and attention to traffic. After 50, your license should expire every two years and you should be required to repeat the tests to continue to drive.U.S. take note please and thank you**70?!** People should have to take a new driving test every 10 years at a max. From driving age through 30, and post-70, it should be every 3 years. Petition to implement a refresher course for drivers every 5 years, and after it snows. 

- Concerned CalgarianCan we please make this 30+? I swear to god I see too many oblivious young adults driving these days... I always said have a refresher after 30, 50, and 70...if you're driving at 90, fuck it! Do what you wantHow has no one mentioned the obvious hole in this idea? What 70 year old do you know would give two shits about this law?  They just will fall into suspension and keep driving anyway, then you'll have a bunch of cops pulling seniors over for easy tickets and then you'll have a bunch of angry 50 year olds. Honestly there needs to be a course for whenever you renew your license, the worst drivers I see are 30-40 somethings who don't signal, don't understand the rules of the road, and are often driving distracted. 

bump that down to 60 and you've got yourself a fresh signature. Honestly, all of that should come as stipulations for stuff like Medicare and the AARP. But, whoe is me, I'm but a normal person without. I remember a store next door to a place a used to work at got their front wall bashed in, right by the parking lot. Apparently it was an ~85 year old lady trying to get out of the parking lot or something.Meh I'd rather have a petition to get them free ubers or automated cars.Why discriminate?  Let's have mandatory retesting every 5 years between getting your license and age 60 then every 2 years.   It'll improve everyone on the road.  Who's against it?  Old farts that vote.  Insurance companies will pay lip-service to it, but their revenues will drop, so they'll remain ambivalent.. claiming a hands-off attitude.  What this isn't already a thing? As an Australian after 75yrs you have mandatory driving tests, and medicals,  my great uncle lost his licence due to this and ended up with a "modified" licence, which kind of restricts how far they are allowed to drive, so they can go to the local shops but driving an hour on the freeway to some other town is a nono.. citation http://m.nrmasaferdriving.com.au/senior-lessons.htmIn Slovakia, elderlypeople over 60 have to retake course, and then after 70 they do the driving test every 2 years.Muscle memory can pass those tests easily....its when you don't remember which pedal does what is when you can no longer get behind the wheel...Younger drivers are MUCH more of a concern. Don't be fooled by anecdotal evidence and South Park episodes. Has anybody else driven at a shopping center during weekdays before everyone at school and work get home? It's like the apocalypseWhy not just restrict old people to cars made of balsa wood and rice paper?I don't think the elderly need a "refresher course".  They should just need to pass a test after a certain age.   Just to make sure they're competent to drive. Petitions never work that shit worthless than dirt. I support this petition because of examples such as this:

http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/live-withington-hospital-car-crash-12705058
Just this weekend I watched what had to be an 80 year old man parallel park his E-class. There wasnt even close to being enough room, but he made room. He backed into the car behind him and just kept backing up until his car fit in the space.If I make it to 70 and this is federal law, I'm just going to say fuck that and drive anyway.The best source of data analysis (in the US) on this comes from insurance company actuaries.

Why not take a look at [two simple graphs?](https://imgur.com/a/KJDXJ)70? How about an actual test to give people licenses in the first place and then a test every 10 years after that. People wouldn't feel the need for self-driving cars if the roads actually had intelligent, rational people on themDrop that to 65 and I'm on board. The written test should also include a brief attention span and reaction time test. Maybe situational awareness too.70? Try fucking 50, the amount of older drivers in my area who are clueless to the modern rules is absurd. I'm at the point I'm terrified of using roundabouts because they don't understand them and just go, or stop inside to let people in causing everyone behind them to slam of their brakes. 50+ years without retests is fucking retarded. Less retarded than how it is currently, but only slightly.Lets start this in Florida!!!Make it 55Why just people over 70? The last time I saw someone use a turn signal, GW Bush was president.  Seems like lots of people need a refresher.I would go one step further and say mandatory basic retest every 5 years to retain your license.EVERY DRIVER needs to have their skills tested every 4 years.Great, now this needs to be a thing in the states. Countless times have I been behind or around people 70+ who are terrible drivers or are completely oblivious to those around them. Heck, one even backed straight into me the other day because they weren't looking in their mirrors or anything.  They just reversed and hoped for the best. I always do a refresher course before I SCUBAUnpopular opinion, but I think EVERYONE should take a refresher course every 10 years a common sense re-test every 5 (or so) years would not go amiss.I wrote and made a speech promoting this exact thing, 15 years ago in college in a "Speech 101" class... and was called an ageist, even though my points were well laid out with facts and statistics.  It's a slippery slope, to say that least.Fuck it should literally be every 10 years. I can't handle my rage at the amount of suck on the roads from so many other drivers.Pilots need a bi-annual flight review every two years in the US, I'm sure the UK has something similar as well. I don't understand why we all don't have to take an annual exam every couple of years or so, seems like the prudent thing to do when you are in charge of a couple-thousand pound vehicle. I bet the car companies would hate that. Please do this in Canada too. I'm pretty sure we have that, but I think we need more. 

Just yesterday I saw a guy who could barely stand up, and could barely count his change when paying the cashier get in a car, nearly smack into the car behind him and then he drove off. Slowly... super slowly... 

If you need to drive 30km in a 60km area for safety reasons such as poor reaction time and eye sight, you probably shouldn't be driving. 

I know.. I know "some day you'll be in his place" but it's easy for me to say this because my car will drive for me when i'm 90 mwahahahaCan we call it "self driving cars 101?"What is the real need behind this refresher?

Yes, I know people may get Alzheimer but when a person with this condition forgets how to eat, I doubt that they will drive.

So the question is what is the problem so we know what we are looking after.I'm not sure about this. The end goal of the course would be to identify issues and have the drivers correct them. What percentage of 70 year olds are willing to change behaviours that have previously worked for them?[removed]Maybe I'm in the minority here, but I think refresher courses every 5 years would be a complete clusterfuck.  What I would recommend is:

1: More stringent training/testing to begin with.  We need to make sure people know how to drive before they are put in the position of being able to kill other people.  Two year learners permit, a stringent driving test, we should be good.

2: The ability for doctors/psychologists to recommend retesting when they believe a person's driving ability to be in danger, and a fine imposed on whoever the hell signed off on Grandpa who can barely navigate his wheelchair continuing to drive.  Age isn't the only thing that changes a person's ability to drive, brain injuries and psychological issues are two of probably many things that can contribute.

3: A refresher course at certain periods, maybe at 60 years old and every 5 years after.

4: If someone is convicted of driving drunk or on drugs, they should never get their license back.  Sorry, it's just the way it should be.

Seriously, people drive every day, so it's the most practiced skill most people have.  There's no reason people between the ages of 18 and late fifties should have to retest constantly, and frankly, that's a recipe for disaster with most DMV's.  Driving tests are not going to fix morons/assholes, and that's where the issue are.  Make it hard to get a license in the first place, so a person really knows how to drive before they can drive, and make punishments for reckless driving harsher.  

It should also be pointed out that before any good legislation can be instituted and ironed out, and definitely before American DMV's would be able to get their shit together (I know, this isn't for the US) HOPEFULLY we will have self-driving cars that make driving safer for everyone.50. Over the age of 50. Cause usually around that age people stop giving a fuck.70? Let's make it 60. I live in Florida. 60 is when they START ignoring speed limit signs and traffic lights, by 70 it's too late. I think every driver should have to re-test at 60, and then every subsequent 5 years after that. Just to be safe. How much inconvenience is it to retake the test?I think there should be a refresher every 5 years at least.Honestly - to prevent arguments of agism, and because there are plenty of fucking god awful drivers who aren't old people why not just have people go through full retests whenever they renew their license?

I mean I think getting bad drivers off the road is a good thing - I am terrified to get in the car with my aunt but she is only 55 and nothing anyone says or does will stop her from driving.  She will likely kill some one one day though.How about all drivers every 5 years or so?There are extremely shitty drivers of all ages.Call it "grandfathered in"70? Should've be at 60, and every 5 years thereafter Link doesn't work. Can we get one of these in the USA too? Or just make it like a "federation" law?[removed][removed][removed]I tend to agree that a license should be skill based.  Hurdling down the road with a two ton weight at 70 mph is a big responsibility.  Maybe if you can't handle it, you shouldn't have access to a license.it says ive already supported this petition, obviously thats a mistake. how do i undo it?[removed]57 fucking signatures?Hell yeah, that’s awesome!Wow, so this is a Georgia state road?

Your previous post about it being a convenient shortcut between two state highways combined with photos of the narrow lanes and adverse gradients made me assume it was a county road that had become over-trafficked.Right on. Not only helps you but might save some lives in the processThat's awesome, especially after going back and checking out the pics..deceptive that curveSome of my former Ga Tech classmates went on to work for Ga DOT. Good folks and excellent engineers.  Congrats on what looks like a path forward.That’s a much better resolution than the suggestions I saw to prevent people from having fatal accidents in your yard by building a rock wall that they would hit before dying outside the perimeter.[deleted]Great to hear that the issue will be fixed! It's always weird to see how reddit helps people but it's amazing when done it does happen.Right on. Always refreshing to hear good news. Your Reddit thread may have inadvertently saved lives, and that's pretty cool.Certainly not every day you catch the attention of the very person you need to help solve a problem on the interwebs, and certainly not very often that it's a government official.

Good to know things are moving for you!Looked at original thread. That looks like a bad corner, obviously. Good on you and Mr. Engineer for trying to fix the issue.What the what! Wholesome reddit cars? Amazed.  

Though, I guess you are, after all...an Emperor?That's awesome that happened, and in my home state as well!That's awesome. I also work for a stage DOT as an engineer, this will be a fun read.That’s awesome, honestly one of those feel good stories. Thank you kind sir for helping this man outThat’s a fantastic outcome. Mr. Engineer is a Marvelous human being. Can’t wait to see the outcome.Off-topic but your house looks amazing. But I also see it’s Georgia so that mansion of yours probably costs less than a 1 bedroom condo in Cali.Very coolGot to shout out for the GA DOT engineers... always top class people and great solutions....


Senior management TDBNot really on topic, but I’m a car crash investigator and I’ve actually gotten crash scene photographs (usually accompanied by descriptions like “holy shit a car just hit my house”) from social media. Telling people shit happened is actually useful sometimes!It's totally worth it to reach out to a DOT engineer especially if you are having persistent issues. I had to deal with an intersection during major construction that would not turn green for 10 minutes if there wasn't 4 or more cars there and was a pain during off hours.

I called up my states DOT and eventually worked though a calling tree and left a message stating the intersection, time of day I was there, what the light wasn't doing, was doing etc.

Two days later I get a phone call back from the engineer that they looked up the intersection in question at that time, found that it wasn't turning for cars and tuned it so that it would turn green periodically, even without detecting many cars. And from then on it was never a problem.I dont wanna burst your bubble but its not gonna be done in a few months. they just started to look at the problem. 
They have to go get the budget for the project. Then hire an engineering firm. Then they'll have to buy some land from your neighbors and you to get the space they need to the new road. They have to make a survey of the place. Then design it.
 Once approved they can finaly go and hire a constructor that will make his own preparation to the project. And only then the work can begin. 
Also since summer is starting soon i dont believe all the design and all can be completed before winter so its gonna be minimum in 1 year. If not 2. And be prepared to gain or loose some of your driveway as the road is not gonna be at the same place prbly. A road that is that dangerous prbly doesnt have the right radius for the speed and its not necessarily the width of the bank etc...That is amazing. I love this site sometimes. Cheers to the anonymous redditor!If you are out there, Mr. Engineer, I thank you. I live on the opposite corner of the country, but I still thank you for making the world a bit safer.This should be headline newsSomething so small making a big impact. Your post likely will save people medical bills and possible death.I grew up with the same issue in Georgia as well. My parents house is in the north Atlanta area and there's a really sharp turn going into a downhill that people speed like crazy around. I can't even count how many mailboxes we've lost from people losing control, busting through the brick mailboxes at the top of our driveway, and then crashing into a tree on our property lol. So many memories over 10+ years of waking up in the middle of the night to an accident lmao. I'm still surprised that nobody had any major injuries, though it did leave me with a lot of paranoia waiting for the school bus every day...I coincidentally just watched a video about why cars crash into buildings more often in the US. Don’t know if it’s of interest or not, but here it is https://youtu.be/Ra_0DgnJ1uQThe second week of living in my present home, someone ran off the road and took out my mailbox.

The previous owner had grown tired of people taking out his box, so he sunk two steel i-beams into a 4’x2’x 1’ deep concrete block an mounted his and the neighbor’s mailbox onto it. 

The car tire marks indicate that the car touched down about 25’ away from the initial mailbox launch point. It then hit an electric pole head on then spun 90 degrees before coming to stop. 

I estimate they were going at least 60-65 on a 35 mph road and what should have been a 25mph curve. Everyone lived, though!As much as I hate Reddit, man do I love reddit. That's awesome.

I looked at the original pictures and I don't really get it. So you live on a straight part, and people are coming out of a curve at the end of your street and crashing into your yard because they can't see the road straightens out?Lmao that george peach accentYea, you can pretty obviously tell in the second picture that the road is banked the wrong way.Fantastic!Glad to see how this turned out!It always makes me smile when people help other people out, and things are set right. Thanks for sharing.This reminds me of [this Practical Engineering video](https://youtu.be/9XIjqdk69O4). Essentially roads need to be curved correctly so drivers can always see the road up ahead. There are so many considerations to take into account.Crack a fat that's a mad outcome :) Nice one mate!Cobb county resident here. Never clicked on the OP but damn that’s a nice house!Very cool! Props to the unidentified engineer! You are awesome!Very good outcome but can they not use road accident data to find these dangerous spots? Surely they should already be aware that this corner was an issue.Now as tenacious d says. “ that’s fucking teamwork!”Thanks for the update!  Read both posts and glad the engineer took it upon himself to make it happen.That's a shitty road for sure, definitely not engineered. 

I ride and do a lot of back roads spirited riding. The reason you can go fast is because roads are engineered to make sense; basically, you can assume a road will curve at a constant rate and the curve will be something you've seen before. After so many miles no curve will really surprise you. 

It's the low traffic, super sparse back roads with no engineering that get you. Once you learn them they're awesome cause you have chicanes and shit like this but new riders fuck up all the time. 

Also, you can't visually follow a tree line to help here, making it extra difficult. 

Case in point - don't speed. But if you do, only do it after you've scouted the road. Otherwise you're just hoping it's engineered well and there's nothing on the road or any of the other 15 things that could fuck you up.I swear this same thing happened to me.  I complained on /r/toronto about how you have 50m to merge into 120kph traffic on the 401, then another 500m to move over 4 lanes.  It had been like that for decades, but 1 week after I complained on Reddit, they fixed it, lengthened the merging lane.The things we car car peeps will geek out about. This is awesome! I can’t wait to see the changes and engineering info!Are you a British guy who moved to the South at age 10Unrelated but I think you have the absolute most perfect southern accent I’ve ever heard.i remember your thread! this in an awe-inspiring response! mad props to that other redditor traffic engineer.So if they bank the turn that means we can take it faster......So badass, props to anonymous! So cool to see a problem fixed due to our favorite circle jerk subreddit.I lost my dad to a motorcycle accident in Gerogia on a curve similar the one you described in your original post. A sincere and heartfelt thanks to both of you for making the roads a safer place.You have a lovely speaking voice. The accent and the chilliness is great.I always wonder how much any given intersection or road is "monitored" by the various DOTs versus just waiting for accident reports to create that feedback loop.  
  
Cool to see this one getting worked on.Yoo, your house is fucking beautiful, my man, I'm quite envious. As for the road, it's awesome to see that everything is going smoothly now, hopefully there are no hang ups and your problem is fixed in no time.

&#x200B;

Now, I'm gonna go look for that vault thread, an underground gun locker seems like just the keep of unachievable fantasy for me.heh, thats pretty freakin awesome.Thank you to our kind engineering stranger!  Keeping people safe and renewing my faith in Reddit once more.are you originally from virginia op?Hahaha, you're born and raised in Georgia aren't you? I'm an Ohioan but I know that accent anywhere, we drove through Georgia just about every year on the way to Florida when my Grandparents were still alive. Georgia has got to be the center of Southern hospitality. I think it was Georgia we always stopped for gas at the border cuz Georgia has (or had) a low gas tax.NiceeeeI'm such an asshole I'd just set up a nice chair on my porch overlooking the curve, crack open a cold one and just enjoy the show.

But I guess it gets old quick.Remind me! 1 monthOP please update this post with the follow thru so my reminders help!
This is one of the coolest internet stories. Well a really cool oneThat’s really coolu/RemindMeBot 2 monthsHe'll fucking yeah my dude. GDOT are goddamn heros. This state is a fucking disaster case when it comes to driving and I'm sure they are all overworked and underpaid. Hope you stop getting lawn ornaments. Can't wait for the next thread.!remindme 1 yearBrilliant!Wouldn't the DOT be keeping crash stats from all over and have this on their radar? Or is this a case of it being on their radar and simply the engineer pushing up the priority?That's amazing. Does he/do you think if I contacted my local DoT/ power company they could move a very unfortunately placed power pole?  If you don't take the turn in front of my parents house you slam into the pole. At least one high school couple has died in their yard from failing the curve.That's great news.  I responded to your last thread suggesting you pester the government more, a traffic engineer responded with some good information on the types of changes they may be able to implement.  Maybe it was him, hope you finally have some peace on your property.This is why I fucking love RedditAnon redditor comes through in the clutch. So awesome.That's so awesome. Things like this are why I love the internetThis is great! Happy for you, man! Keep us all informed.thats awesome man and what a beautiful home !Amazing, Ill be looking forward to see the progress.this is just awesomeI’m getting chills thinking about this. Did something positive come from Reddit.  Good work anonymous inspector dude.!remindme 4 monthsDamn. I get frequent car crashes in my front yard as well. Almost killed our whole family once, ran right into our gas main. All the signage and even some banking mean nothing. Once a month someone ends up in the dirt. Could use a nice engineer friend.In Seoul, South Korea there is a city app where you upload pics of problems with a geo tag and it will be reviewed and fixed if needed. I think this is a excellent idea.Congrats on finding a solution.
